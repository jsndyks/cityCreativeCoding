<p>Hi everyone ...</p>
<p>Wow ... you have some capability now, and we want you to use some of this to begin 'Thinking like a Programmer ...'</p>
<p>There are two ways forward in class this morning - feel free to work in ways that suit you:</p>
<ol>
<li>Work through the <a href="https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/mod/page/view.php?id=420963">Thinking like a programmer</a> lecture, which <b>Andy</b> will introduce and fork through in <i>The Great Hall</i> at 12 noon</li>
<li>Keep playing and experimenting with the Images, Art, Randomness, Sound and Data that we introduced recently to do interesting things</li> 
</ol>
<p>You decide, and chat with colleagues and teaching staff to make progress</p>
<p>I am in the <a href="">Zoom Room</a> from 10-11:50 to chat with beginners!<br/>
I can explain code and concepts, debug, reassure - anything really!<br/>
Just jump in while you are in the practical class - with headphones.</p>
<p><b>Jason</b></p>
