Read the lecture through and try the *core* and *coding tasks* as you go - and be sure to play the *movies*.
The combination of *explanatory text*, *examples* and *self-paced exercises* is intended to help you achieve the learning outcomes.

If you want to test yourself then try the *challenge tasks* and feel free to riff on these a little.

You can access the [Data Visualization Lecture](https://jsndyks.github.io/cityCreativeCoding/html/dataVis/ccDataVis.2024.html) outside of _Moodle_ should you wish to do so.

            <p>
                This session introduces the idea of <b>data visualization</b> — turning data into graphics.<br/>
                In particular it focusses on how to ...</p>
                <ul><li><b>read</b> text that contains data from files into <em>Processing</em>,
                and how to</li>
                <li><b>parse</b> the text to extract words and numbers that you can use as variables in your sketches.</li></ul>
                <p>In combination, this enables you to use <i>data</i> to position, shape, colour and control elements in your sketch as you <i>depict</i> data in ways that may lead to insight and <i>discovery</i>.</p>
            <p>
                In doing so it may give you ideas about ways in which you can use data visualization in your <i>Dear Data</i> sketch.
                The various challenges are designed to help you develop and implement ideas.
                <!-- We'd love to see some <b>data</b> in your demos! -->

            <p><strong>If you read through these lecture notes, attempt the tasks and exercises and use the resources
                    that we have made available, then by the end of this session you should be able to:</strong></p>

            <ul>
                <li>Drag and drop data files into your <em>Processing</em> code window to make them accessible to your sketches;</li>
                <li>Create a sketch to read a text file using <a href="http://processing.org/reference/loadStrings_.html"
                    target="_blank"><code>loadStrings()</code></a>;</li>
                <li>Split a line of text into <i>tokens</i> representing individual words or numbers;</li>
                <li>Rescale a number from one range to another using the <a href="https://processing.org/reference/map_.html"><code>map()</code></a> command;</li>
                <li>Use data that you have read from a file to change the colour, size or appearance of
                    graphics to depict the data in your sketch.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Remember, that to achieve this you will need to read these notes through and ...</p>
            <div class="codeTask" style="padding-bottom:2em"><br/>complete all of the <b>coding tasks</b> that you see, either in the lecture when we
                try things out, or in the lab afterwards with the help of your teachers, or in your own time subsequently.</div>

                the lab, or in your own time.</div>

            </p>
            <div class="challenge" style="padding-bottom:2em"><br/>try some of the <i>optional</i> <b>challenges</b> to test yourself and learn a little more.
                <br /><br />But also, know that you can come back to these later and that we don't expect everybody to
                try them - these tasks are to <b>challenge</b> the students in the group who are moving quickly and who probably
                have some previous experience of programming.
            </div>

            <p>If you have completed all the work on this page and want to learn more, the try the optional <b><a

                <i>Live Data</i>, <i>Bikes</i> and <i>Books</i>.
                This could well be fun for some of you and may give you ideas for ways of data visualization in your

                <p>Before we get going, you'll need some data and to know about an important new method - <a href="http://processing.org/reference/loadStrings_.html"

                    They will ensure that you know how to use <a href="http://processing.org/reference/loadStrings_.html"
                        target="_blank"><code>loadStrings()</code></a> to load <i>Strings</i> from a file and into your sketch.

                    <p>
                        We will be using a simple data file, shown here to the right, when live coding in the lecture - <a
                            href="https://jsndyks.github.io/cityCreativeCoding/data/namesData.txt"
                            target="_blank">namesData.txt</a>
                    </p>
                    <p>It is a text file containing data that are separated on each line by commas - on <i>comma separated value (CSV)</i> form.</p>
                    <p>
                        So please <strong>download this data file in advance</strong>.<br/>
                        You should right-click the link above to download and save a copy.<br />
                        It's important that you <strong>make sure you know where the file has been saved</strong> on
                        your laptop.
                        <br />
                        You can add the file to a <em>Processing</em> sketch by finding it in <i>Finder</i> (Mac) or <i>File Explorer</i> (Windows) and dragging it into the sketch code window.<br />
                        The data were created with the <a href="https://www.mockaroo.com">mockaroo</a> Random Data
                        Generator.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When you have done so, open a new sketch and use <code>loadStrings("namesData.txt")</code> to
                        load the contents of the file into an array of <code>String</code>s.<br /></p>
                        <pre class="brush: processing; gutter: false; toolbar: false;">
                            // Read a text file into an array names 'lines' with loadStrings()
                            String[] lines = loadStrings("namesData.txt");</pre>
                        <p>
                        Each line of the data file will be loaded into an element of the array, in turn.</p>
                        <p>
                          So, <code>lines[0]</code> will contain ...<br/><code>Nora Gigg,1,4,851,1995,Female,3XL,#b002f7,ngigg0@telenet.co</code>.</p>
                          <p>And, <code>lines[1]</code> will contain ...<br/><code>Bobby Montague,0,3,2758,1967,Male,XL,#45ac24,bobbymont@skype.com</code>.</p>
                          <p>And, <code>lines[9]</code> will contain ...<br/><code>Jason Daouze,0,2,1113,2006,Male,S,#0230cc,jdaouze9@xrea.com</code>, etc.</p>
                          <p style="padding-bottom:1em">
                            We can use <a href="https://processing.org/reference/printArray_.html"><code>printArray()</code></a> to see the contexts of our new array of data.

                <h3>1. Introduction to Data Visualization</h3>

                <p>
                    So far, most of the sketches you have built have involved creating some form of visual
                    representation
                    that you as a programmer have controlled (e.g. by putting numbers into your program code or asking
                    <em>Processing</em>
                    to generate random numbers for you), or you as a user have influenced (e.g. by moving the mouse or
                    pressing
                    keys).
                </p>

                <p>
                    Data visualization is all about making meaningful, informative, readable, graphical representations of <b>data</b>.
                    These data are usually created
                    externally, outside your program, and you write code to read those data into your program and show them
                    graphically. The data can be of all sorts of things - daily temperatures, Twitter messages, player performance in football matches, Moodle usage statistics, code commits, data generated in real time by sensors in the urban environment or complex model outputs that might, for example, be predicting patterns of disease.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Data can be turned into graphics in very different ways and for many different purposes. These range
                    from</p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>more <b>artistic representations</b> with more focus on the visual and interactive design than the
                    data that
                    underlie them;</li><li>more <b>communicative representations</b> where a particular story is being told using data; or</li><li>
                    more
                    <b>scientific representations</b> that help investigate scientific questions by assisting
                    scientists in finding patterns in data and relationships between datasets.</li></ul>
                    <p>Each of these will have different implications
                    for visual design, but they all follow the same general pattern of transforming some form of dataset
                    into some form of graphical depiction.
                </p>

                <h4>Examples</h4>

                <p>
                    The web has many, many creative visual representations of data.
                    This is in part due to the popularity and
                    importance of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_data" target="_blank">Open Data</a> and
                    also because many of the various technologies that enable people to process this data - such as
                    <em>Processing</em>.
                    Other languages and programming frameworks are also common.
                    Here are just a few examples of sites that contain interesting and informative data visualization:

                <h3>2. Getting simple text data into a sketch</h3>
                <p>
                    So how do we make a connection between the data we might want to visualize and our coding
                    instructions?
                    Thankfully <em>Processing</em> offers us several built-in methods for reading data, whether it comes
                    from text files, activity trackers, remote databases or the Web.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Perhaps the easiest to use is the <a href="http://processing.org/reference/loadStrings_.html"
                        target="_blank"><code>loadStrings()</code></a>
                    method that reads in a text file into an array of <i>String</i>s.</p>
                    <p>To see how it works, lets adapt a sketch we have seen before that displays some names stored in an array:
                </p>

            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="units-row">
            <div class="unit-70-cc">
                <!-- Row break ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ -->
                <pre class="brush: processing; gutter: false; toolbar: false;">String[] names;

void setup()
{
  size(300,580);
  fill(0);
  textSize(14);  // -- try changing the size of the text

  names = loadStrings("names.txt");
}

void draw()
{
  background(255);
  float yPos = 25;  // -- try changing the starting position on the Y axis (25)

  for (String name : names)
  {
    text(name,20,yPos);
    yPos = yPos+28; // -- try changing the line by line vertical offset (28)
  }
}</pre>

                <p>
                    Notice that nowhere in the code is there any list of the actual names to display. Instead the
                    <a href="http://processing.org/reference/loadStrings_.html"><code>loadStrings()</code></a>
                    method looks for a data file called <code>names.txt</code> that contains the data - the text containing the names.
                    Each line
                    from this data
                    file is read into a separate element in an array that we've called <code>names</code> in this
                    example.</p>
                    <p>
                    The <code>draw()</code> method then uses a for-each loop to iterate through this array, displaying
                    each element one-by-one. So the output of our sketch is determined by the data. More names in the
                    file, will give us more names on the canvas, with the same code.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In order for <em>Processing</em> to know where to look to find the file <code>names.txt</code>, it
                    needs to be created somewhere and then dragged into the <em>Processing</em> window.
                    This will make a copy of the file in the <em>Processing</em> sketch folder, from which <em>Processing</em> can access and read the lines of text.

                    Instead of a simple list of names, we can use the same approach to read in a larger text file. For
                    example, <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org" target="_blank">Project Gutenberg</a> provides a
                    repository for free electronic copies of thousands of books.
                    The content of all sorts of interesting books is available as text files.
                    We can use this repository as a source of data for our sketches.</p>
                    <p>Below is a sketch that displays the contents of H.G. Wells' classic book
                    '<em>The Time Machine</em>' <a href="https://jsndyks.github.io/cityCreativeCoding/data/theTimeMachine.txt"
                        target="_blank">stored in a text file</a>.
                </p>
                <p>Each line of text in the file contains a whole paragraph, and the sketch reads the file in with <a href="http://processing.org/reference/loadStrings_.html" target="_blank"><code>loadStrings()</code></a> and then displays one line at a time.

                        You could always read it ...?<br />

                    The only element of this sketch that may be new is that we are using a slightly different version of
                    <em>Processing</em>'s
                    <a href="https://processing.org/reference/text_.html"><code>text()</code></a> method that takes 5
                    parameters — the text string to display, the position of the
                    top-left of the text area and the width and height of the text area. When specified like this (i.e.
                    as a rectangle),
                    <em>Processing</em> will attempt to lay out the text, line by line, within the rectangle. This saves
                    us having to update
                    the position of each line as we did in the first example.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Add this <code>keyPressed()</code> method to skip forward and backward a line with the <span class="key">&lt;</span> and <span class="key">&gt;</span> keys.
                    This works by using the keys to update the variable <code>lineToDisplay</code>, which is used to determine the array index used to select the currently displayed line.
                </p>
                <p>You can then change the line that is displayed interactively - use the <span class="key">&lt;</span> and
                <span class="key">&gt;</span> keys to display the book, one paragraph at a time.<br/>
                Clicking the 'space bar' will display line 10 - this is the first line of the content of the book - the title.</p>

                <h3>3. Extracting tokens from a line of text</h3>
                <p>
                    The text that we have loaded so far is largely <i>unstructured</i>.
                    While each line in the file is a sentence or paragraph of the book, and they are in the order in which
                    they should be read, the text within the lines does not have any specific structure.</p>
                    <p>But data are often, and most usefully, stored in text text files with more explicit structure.
                  Our early examples in <a href="https://jsndyks.github.io/cityCreativeCoding/data/names.txt"
                          target="_blank">names.txt</a> were like this - data values separated by <b>commas</b>.</p>
                <p>
                    For example, each line may be a <em>record</em> about a thing that we are interested in,
                    such as a GPS reading at a particular time, or a day of the week about which we have information.
                    It may contain multiple pieces of information about the thing, such as the thing's position and elevation in the first case, or 
                    the thing's maximum heart rate recorded by an activity tracker for each hour of the day in the second.
                    And if these pieces of information about multiple things are in a consistent order then we can compare the things (people, days, whatever).</p>

                    <h5>Bike Ride 🚴🏼</h5>
                    <p>For example, here are the <i>elevations</i> I was at on my bike for particular <i>times</i> during a short period the other afternoon while my GPS was tracking me:</p>

                    <pre style="margin-top:1em; margin-bottom:1em">141.3,16:00:01
141.4,16:00:02
141.4,16:00:03
141.5,16:00:04
141.6,16:00:05
141.8,16:00:06
141.9,16:00:07
142.0,16:00:08
142.2,16:00:09
142.3,16:00:10</pre>

                <p>Each row of this data file is a recording made by, and downloaded from, the GPS. I can download a CSV file from the GPS app.
                    Each contains an elevation (in metres above sea level) and the time at which the recording was made, separated by a comma. 
                    The data shown above are for the first 10 seconds after 4pm when I was climbing pretty steadily and ascended a whole metre!
                    But the GPS captured data more than 7,000 times over the afternoon and you can see all of the records here:
                <a href="https://jsndyks.github.io/cityCreativeCoding/data/elevationData.txt" target="_blank">elevationData.txt</a><br/>

                <p>Loading these data into <em>Processing</em> and converting them into graphics is revealing.
                These are just <code>line()</code>s positioned in x according to time and with the 4th argument (<i>y2</i>) based on elevation.</p>

                <img src="https://jsndyks.github.io/cityCreativeCoding/images/elevationTime.noColour.png" width="800" height="67"/>

                <p>You don't often see profiles over time. The climbs are lengthened and the descents shortened compared to physical profiles - because I ride quite a lot slower uphill than I descend downhill.
                This <i>feels</i> much more like the ride itself - with an emphasis on the up, which is where I spend most of my time! 
                The gaps are at times when the GPS was not tracking me - I was stationary here: having a drink, taking a photo, or in the first case tip-toeing through the house in my cycling cleats to pick up my jacket as I had to turn back and head home to grab it when it started raining!</p>
                <p>We might use a couple of conditions in the code (<code>if()</code>) to colour the lines according to whether I was climbing or ascending.<br/> We can calculate this by looking at successive data values. We can add an <code>if()</code> to only colour above a certain threshold of gradient, to highlight the steep parts of the ride.<br/>
                    This is achieved with <a href="https://processing.org/reference/colorMode_.html"><code>colorMode(HSB)</code></a>, which enables you to define colours according to their <i>Hue</i>, <i>Saturation</i> and <i>Brightness</i>.</p>
                <img src="https://jsndyks.github.io/cityCreativeCoding/images/elevationTime.upAndDown.Steep.png" width="800" height="67"/>
                <p>Or for the entire ride, which looks pretty nice.</p>
                <img src="https://jsndyks.github.io/cityCreativeCoding/images/elevationTime.upAndDown.All.png" width="800" height="67"/>
                <p>Here, I vary the colours according to the data, so that the the intensity and opacity of the colours are dependent on the gradient. Steeper is bluer or redder, and brighter, than shallower which is more washed out.</p>
                <img src="https://jsndyks.github.io/cityCreativeCoding/images/elevationTime.upAndDown.Gradient.png" width="800" height="67"/>
                <p> You can see that it's pretty bumpy near the end. No wonder I got home with tired legs (and soaking wet, despite the 'waterproof' jacket that I picked up).</p>
                    
                <h5>Heart Rate ❤️</h5>
                <p style="padding-top:1em">Here is another example.
                        This text file contains more data per line, and might be the basis of the <em>Year of NikeFuel</em> data visualization we saw earlier - <a href="https://jsndyks.github.io/cityCreativeCoding/data/hourlyBPM.txt"
                        target="_blank">hourlyBPM.txt</a>.
                        Here, each row is a day.
                        Each line contains the name of the day and then 24 numbers that show maximum heart rate for each hour of the day. These are not real data:

                <p>
                    We have seen that the <code>loadStrings()</code> method is very useful when you wish to read in
                    lines of text into an array, line by line.
                    But sometimes we may wish to go further than this and extract the individual elements <i>within</i>
                    each line.
                    For example, the words that make up a sentence or the numbers in the kinds of comma separated lists
                    of numbers (or rows of numbers) in the <a href="https://jsndyks.github.io/cityCreativeCoding/data/elevationData.txt" target="_blank">elevation data</a> or the <a href="https://jsndyks.github.io/cityCreativeCoding/data/hourlyBPM.txt"
                    target="_blank">heart rate data</a> shown above.
                    These elements are often referred to as <i>tokens</i> and the process of extracting them as <i>parsing</i>.
                    This is what I did to extract the times and elevations from the <a href="https://jsndyks.github.io/cityCreativeCoding/data/elevationData.txt" target="_blank">elevationData.txt</a>
                    file to convert it into the time profile: I <i>parsed</i> each line of the file, and split it into tokens using the comma as a separator. 
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>token</b> - part of a longer <i>String</i> that relates to a particular data value;</li>
                    <li><b>separator</b> - a character or <i>String</i> that separates <i>tokens</i> in longer <i>String</i>s;</li>
                    <li><b>parsing</b> - the process of extracting tokens from a <i>String</i> - usually involving splitting <i>String</i>s at <i>separators</i>;</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    <em>Processing</em> provides a useful command to help with parsing tokens — <code><a
                        href="http://processing.org/reference/split_.html" target="_blank">split()</code></a>.
                </p>
                    <p>This method will take a string and a <i>separator</i> as parameters and split the text up into an
                    array of smaller strings, using the separator character to divide the text.
                    </p>

                <p>Read that sentence one more time!</p>

                <p>This method will take a string and a <i>separator</i> as parameters and split the text up into an
                    array of smaller strings, using the separator character to divide the text.
                </p>

                <p>Let's say that again and take it slowly ...<br />
                    If a <i>String</i> (such as one that you load from a line of a text file) contains a series of
                    characters that are separated by a <i>separator</i> (such as a comma), then <code><a
                        href="http://processing.org/reference/split_.html" target="_blank">split()</code></a> will convert the
                    <i>String</i> into an array containing each of the parts of the <i>String</i> that are separated by
                    the <i>separator</i>. These are the tokens!

                <h4>Extracting numeric values</h4>
                <p>
                    The same principle can be used to extract numeric values from a line of structured text, like the
                    ones we saw in the heart rate data above.
                    As we have seen, numbers
                    in a text file might be separated by commas rather than spaces, so it becomes a simple matter of
                    passing a comma <code>","</code>
                    rather than a space <code>" "</code> as the argument used to define the separator when calling the <code>split()</code> method.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Here's an example that reads in a set of numbers representing daily temperatures and displays a
                    series of
                    rectangles that are sized according to the temperature of each day. Note that in this example (and
                    the one
                    above) we are assigning the value of the <code>textLine</code> variable explicitly within our code,
                    but a
                    real data visualization application is likely to read these values from a file using the approaches
                    that we have learned about above 👆.

                    The only command that may be new to you in this example is the use of a method called
                    <code>float()</code>
                    that converts the text of a number parsed from the <code>String</code> into a numeric
                    <code>float</code> variable so that we can use it as a number and do some maths with it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    An obvious problem with the sketch is that the bar heights do not vary very much since we are
                    representing
                    the data (degrees Celsius) directly as pixel units (e.g. 19 degrees Celsius is shown as a rectangle
                    19 pixels
                    high).
                </p>


                <p>
                    It is quite common in data visualization to want to rescale data values so they match the sizes in
                    pixel units
                    we wish to use. We could achieve this by multiplying each data value (stored in the
                    <code>temperature</code> variable
                    above) by some value, say 4, so that 19 Celsius becomes 19*4 = 76 pixels tall.
                    </p>
                <p>A more general and widely useful approach
                    would be to use <em>Processing</em>'s <a href="http://processing.org/reference/map_.html" target="_blank"><code>map()</code></a> command that rescales any number from a

                        The next pair of parameters are the minimum and maximum data values we can expect our data value to fall between.

                    Let's bring together the three things we have been focussing on :</p>

                    <li>reading of text files - <code>loadStrings()</code></li>
                    <li>parsing of lines of text into tokens - <code>split()</code></li>
                    <li>converting text strings into numbers - <code>float()</code></li>
                </ul>
                <p>We can do so with a data visualization example.<br />
                    Our example attempts to visualize data from the <a
                        href="https://tfl.gov.uk/modes/cycling/santander-cycles" target="_blank">London Cycle Hire
                        Scheme</a>.

                </p>
                <p>
                    Transport for London release some very large datasets that include the <a
                        href="http://cycling.data.tfl.gov.uk/" target="_blank">times and places of all journeys made using the bikes</a>.
                    <!-- This could be great source of data and ideas for your demo. -->
                    But for now we are going to use a simpler dataset that records how many bikes
                    are docked at a series of docking stations at various points in time.
                    The first few rows and columns of this table of data look like this:
                </p>
                <img src="https://jsndyks.github.io/cityCreativeCoding/images/formattedStationStatus.png" width="1530"
                    height="427">

                <p style="padding-top:2em">
                    Each row (apart from the first 'header' row) contains data about a particular bicycle docking station. It has its own unique numeric identifier, or ID (column 0); a name (column 1); a geographic location specified as a pair of
                    Ordnance Survey map coordinates (columns 2 and 3); the number of bikes capable of being docked at the station (column 4); and then the number of bikes actually docked at the station at 30 minute intervals from midnight to midnight (columns 5 to the end).
                </p>

                <p>
                    The full table can be downloaded as <a
                        href="https://jsndyks.github.io/cityCreativeCoding/data/bikeShare.txt"

                    (right-click to download).
                    Each bike station has its own line in the file and each value in every row is separated
                    with a comma. This makes it an ideal format for reading with <code>loadStrings()</code> and then parsing with <code>split()</code>.

                    Rather than visualizing this information as a series of bars, we could use the location data for
                    each docking station to produce a simple map.</p>
                <p>
                    All we do here is plot a symbol for each station at a position on the canvas that is based upon the
                    <i>geographic information</i> that we have read from the file - this is in columns 2 and 3.</p>
                <p> For example, we might show each station as a circle.
                    We could make the size of the circle relate to the number of bikes that the station is capable of
                    storing (its capacity):
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the sketch that follows we read in values from columns 2 and 3 representing the coordinates of each docking station.
                    These numbers are <i>Ordnance Survey</i> grid coordinates at 1m resolution.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To fit the data onto the screen we need to translate them into locations on the canvas in pixels.
                    The <a href="https://processing.org/reference/map_.html"><code>map()</code></a> command for
                    rescaling the numbers will do this for us. But to get the scaling right, we need to know the
                    geographic range of our data is. Here we store this in the variables <code>NORTH</code>, <code>SOUTH</code>,
                    <code>EAST</code> and <code>WEST</code>.
                    These are the geographic extents of our data - the boundaries of our map, 
                    the coordinates of the lines that define the top, bottom, left and right of the geographic area
                    into which we are <a href="https://processing.org/reference/map_.html"><code>map()</code>ping our data.</a>

        <h3>5. Summary</h3>

        <p>You now have what you need to do some basic data visualization, and hopefully you can look back at the movies
            we introduced earlier and begin to imagine the kinds of data and the types of sketch and commands that may
            have been used to produce them. It's worth looking back and having a think about how these designs might
            have been implemented now that you know some of the tricks and have engaged with the code.</p>
        <p>The most important thing is that you know that:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Data visualization is all about turning data into graphics - depicting data visually.
            </li>
            <li>
                This usually involves reading from a data file and storing the data in variables so they can be used in
                your sketches.
            </li>
            <li>
                <em>Processing</em> contains a useful method for reading lines of text from a file —
                <a href="http://processing.org/reference/loadStrings_.html" target="_blank"><code>loadStrings()</code></a>
            </li>
            <li>
                Elements within a line of text such as words or numbers can be <i>parsed</i> and extracted in
                <em>Processing</em> using
                the <a href="http://processing.org/reference/split_.html" target="_blank"><code>split()</code></a> method.
            </li>
            <li>
                We can use <a href="https://processing.org/reference/map_.html"><code>map()</code></a> to re-scale our data from the original numeric range of the data set to a range to a new one that allows us to position shapes in ways that that represent the numbers in screen coordinates.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you do know these things, and you can use these methods and understand how to draw shapes with variables,
            then you are pretty much set - <b>the World is your Data Visualization oyster</b> ...</p>

        <p>Remember, that we expect you all to complete all of the <i>code tasks</i> and <i>core tasks</i>.</p>
        <p>Remember that we don't expect this to be straightforward. We expect you to experiment, use your debugging
            skills and to discuss solutions and approaches and problems and errors with student colleagues and teaching
            staff. You will recall what we learned at the outset:</p>
            <blockquote>
            if you want to be a good coder, you need to code, and<br/>
            the more you practice the easier it gets
            </blockquote>
            <p>Really.<br/>Stick with it.</p>

          <h3>6. Reading</h3>
          <p>It's BootCamp - so there is no reading.</p>
          <p>But if you are interested in data visualization and want to find out more, we have a <b><a href="https://libraryservices.city.ac.uk/">library</a></b>, which has some excellent and sources - inspiring and informative.
          You'll find that quite a lot of the material is available online too!</p>

					<div class="challenge">
          <p>
              <b>Finding out More ...</b><br/>
 					  There are some fantastic books that explain approaches to designing <b>effective</b> data visualization.</p>
          <p>
					  You may wish to have a look at Isabel Meirelles lovely book on <a href="http://isabelmeirelles.com/book-design-for-information/" target="_blank">Design for Information</a>. It's full of exciting ideas and they are beautifully explained. You can get the whole thing <a href="http://tinyurl.com/yy9rtwgj">fully online</a> through the City library.
          </p>
          <p>
            A more comprehensive and scholarly coverage of approaches to information visualization is provided by Tamara Munzner in <a href="https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~tmm/vadbook/" target="_blank">Visualization Analysis and Design</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
					  There are multiple copies of both books available in the university library:
            </p><ul>
              <li><a target="_blank" href="https://library.city.ac.uk/record=b1906639">Meirelles (2013)</a></li>
              <li><a target="_blank" href="https://library.city.ac.uk/record=b2050388">Munzner (2015)</a></li>
            </ul>
          <p>See if you can use any of the ideas in the books to inform your data visualization.</p>
