            Some optional **Extra Challenges** - to give you some ideas in case you want to do more _data visualization_ (and why wouldn't you?) ...

            You can access the [Data Visualization : Extra](https://jsndyks.github.io/cityCreativeCoding/html/dataVis/ccDataVis.2024.extra.html) challenges outside of _Moodle_ should you wish to do so.

         -->

        <!-- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Introduction ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ -->
        <!-- TITLE HEADING OF PAGE SHOULD BE VIA MOODLE, NOT HERE -->
        <!-- Content below -->


        <p class="intro">
            If you have completed the core and coding tasks in the <a
                href="https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/mod/page/view.php?id=822874">Data Visualization : Core</a> materials then you
            have have achieved plenty.<br />
            But, you want more eh?<br />
            OK, that's good.<br />
            If you'd like to try some more <b>optional</b> data visualization challenges and to improve your skills and experience in
            this area then there are some possibilities for you here. But these are by no mean obligatory challenges and we don't expect many students to attempt them.
        </p>

        <p class="intro">
            These additional exercises give you practice developing data visualization sketches.
            The options are almost endless, but considering and attempting some of these challenges may help you develop
            a Data Visualization project.
        </p>

        <hr class="hrClear"/>

        <!--div class="tip">
    <p>
	 We expect you to show that you can load and use some <b>DATA</b> as part of your project.<br>
   We'd like to hear about how you do so, and for you explain your use of data in the Friday showcase.
   </p>
 </div-->

 <h3>Bike Maps</h3>
 <p>Build on the <i>Bike Map</i> task in the <a href="https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/mod/page/view.php?id=822874">Data Visualization : Core</a> materials to add some interesting and useful interactive features to your sketch.</p>

 <div class="challenge">
    <h5>Challenge - Adding Interaction to the Cycling Data Scripts</h5>
        Of course, there are many other things you can usefully do here.<br />
        See whether you can ...</p>
    <ol start="5">
        <li>Show the differences between two times<br />
            <i>Hint: This will involve calculating differences between two
                <code>floats</code> that you extract from the array of <code>values</code> and you will
                end up with negative numbers - but we have thought about how to visualize negative
                numbers in the lecture.</i></li>
        <li>Only show stations that have particular names or geographic locations<br />
            <em>Hint: You'll have to record the station name as a <code>String</code> when you read
                values from the lines of text.</em>
        </li>
        <li>Use squares or bars in the map instead of circles - you could use multiple bars to show a series of times concurrently;</li>
        <li>Scale the circles (or squares or bars) differently, to make them bigger or smaller;</li>
    </ol>
</div>

<div class="challenge">
    <h5>Challenge - Adding MORE Interaction to the Cycling Data Scripts</h5>
        Why not make things even MORE interactive?</p>
    <ol start="9">
        <li>Can you add an interaction to the bar graph that allows us to scroll up and down through the
            data file, while always showing data for 25 stations?<br />
            <em>Hint: you will need to replace the numeric values used to identify the column in which
                the 9:00am data is stored, and the lines that are used in the loop, with variables that
                change in response to particular inputs.</em>
        </li>
        <li>Can you scale the circles (or squares or bars) differently in response to key presses that
            make them bigger or smaller;</li>
        <li>
            Can you change the time that is shown dynamically, showing data for successive time
            periods?<br />
            This could be according to some input (keyboard, mouse) or time (animation)<br />
            You could do this for the graph or the map.<br />
            <em>Hint: You will need to read in one or more of the columns containing the number of bikes
                docked at the station.
                If you wish to show more than one time of day in the same sketch, you will probably
                need to store the bike numbers
                in a 2D array where 1 dimension is the docking station and the other is the time of
                day.</em>
        </li>
    </ol>
</div>



        <div class="challenge">
            <h5>Extra Challenge - Live Bike Data Visualization</h5>
            <p>The bike scheme data that you have used so far is from <i>2015</i>.</p>
            <p>
                <b>Live</b> bike data, showing what is going on across London <i>right now</i> is available from <a
                    href="https://www.staff.city.ac.uk/~sbbb717/tfl_bikes/latest-tsv.php"
                    target="_blank">https://www.staff.city.ac.uk/~sbbb717/tfl_bikes/latest-tsv.php</a>.<br/>
                Copy your solution from the previous task and modify it to use this live data.
            </p>
            <p>
                <i>Hints:</i>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Open the latest data file in a browser to see the structure of the data.
                </li>
                <li>You can put the URL directly as the <code>loadStrings()</code> parameter - your sketch will then
                    always use the latest data!
                </li>
                <li>This file is tab - rather than comma - separated. You'll need to use
                    <code>split(textLines[i], "\t");</code> to split the text on the tab character.<br/>
                    The <code>\t</code>
                    represents a tab character in <em>Processing</em>.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="challenge">
            <h5>Extra Challenge - Refactoring Your Visualization</h5>
            <p>If you have managed all of that, then try designing a <code>DockingStation</code> class that stores the
                name and other data that relate to the docking station.<br/>Refactor your code from the previous tasks so
                that data from each docking station is stored in a <code>DockingStation</code> object.</p>
            <p>
                <i>Hint: </i> Make another tab and put the code that defines the <code>DockingStation</code> class in
                there.<br/>In your main sketch, you'll be able to create objects, store them in an array or
                <code>ArrayList</code> and display graphical representations of them.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h3>Book Graphics</h3>

        <p>You may prefer books to bikes, and so can have fun experimenting with visualization of literature.</p>

        <div class="challenge">
            <h5>Extra Challenge - Visualizing a Book</h5>
            <p>You may want to see whether you can visualize a text file.
                The methods you are using here with small data files can be applied to larger files too.</p>
            <p>See what you can find at <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org" target="_blank">Project Gutenberg</a>,
                elsewhere online, or in your own file-space.
                We will be impressed if you can find patterns in your data - and explain the code that enables you to do
                this data visualization.</p>
            <p>
                See whether you can develop the sketches that you produced when we were considering <em>The Time Machine</em> to show where in the book the terms in a particular phrase occur?
                Or perhaps try this with key characters in a book you know well.<br />
                You could apply this approach to find words in a song, or characters in a screenplay.<br />
                Your solution might look something like this ...</p>
            <p>
                <img src="https://jsndyks.github.io/cityCreativeCoding/images/dataVis/darkNight.png" width="800" height="180">
            </p>

            <p>
                This kind of sketch might enable you to find patterns in text files that you download, particularly if
                you add some interactions to change the phrases or characters that you are searching for.<br />
                For example, you may find data files online, and write sketches in class, that enable you to determine:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>When do the terms 'good' and 'bad' appear in a text that you download from <a
                        href="http://www.gutenberg.org" target="_blank">Project Gutenberg</a>?</li>
                <li>Which pairs of characters tend to appear together most commonly in the screenplay of <em>Star Wars -
                        A New Hope</em> ?</li>
                <li>Just how often did the <em>The Beatles</em> use the term '<em>yeah</em>' in their lyrics and did this vary as time
                    passed?</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                Consider a <code>Book</code> class that displays the content of a book in interesting ways and enables you to see summaries of the contents, and compare the 'data' in books.
            </p>
            <p>Or, be inspired by <a href="https://medium.com/@neuroecology/punctuation-in-novels-8f316d542ec4#.cx4yrsrnv">Adam J Calhoun</a> and his visualization of the <i><a href="https://medium.com/@neuroecology/punctuation-in-novels-8f316d542ec4#.cx4yrsrnv">Punctuation in Novels</a></i>.<br/>
              <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org" target="_blank">Project Gutenberg</a> provides lots of scope for this kind of thing.</p>

            <h5>Extra Challenge - Find and Visualize Your Own Data</h5>
            <p>
                Can you find your own simple dataset to visualize?</p>
            <p>Search for, or create, a simple text file containing some words
