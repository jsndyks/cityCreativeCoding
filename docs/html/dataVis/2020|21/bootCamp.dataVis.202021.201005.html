			<p>
        This session introduces the idea of <b>data visualization</b> — turning data into graphics. In particular it focusses on how to read text from files into <em>Processing</em> and how to <i>parse</i> the text to extract words and numbers that you can use as variables in your sketches. This means that you can read data and use it to position, shape and colour elements in your sketch.</p>
      <p>
        In doing so it may give you ideas about ways in which you can use data visualization in your project.
        The various challenges are designed to help you develop project ideas.
        We'd love to see some <b>data</b> in your projects!

        <p><strong>If you read through these lecture notes, attempt the tasks and exercises and use the resources that we have made available, then by the end of this session you should be able to:</strong></p>

			<ul>
				<li>Drag and drop data files into your <em>Processing</em> code window;</li>
				<li>Create a sketch to read a text file using <code>loadStrings()</code>;</li>
        <li>Split a line of text into <i>tokens</i> representing individual words or numbers;</li>
        <li>Rescale a number from one range to another using the <code>map()</code> command;</li>
        <li>Use data that you have read from a file and rescaled to change the colour, size or appearance of graphics in your sketch.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Remember, that to achieve this you will need to read these notes through and ...</p>
      <div class="codeTask">complete all of the <b>coding tasks</b> that you see, either in the lecture when we try things out, or in the lab afterwards with the help of your teachers.</div>
      <div class="coreTask">complete all of the <b>core tasks</b> that are included, either in the lecture or in the lab.</div>

      <p>If you have completed the <b>coding tasks</b> and would like to try some more challenging tasks, then ...</p>
      <div class="challenge">try some of the <b>challenges</b> to test yourself and learn a little more.
        <br/><br/>But also, know that you can come back to these later and that we don't expect everybody to try them - these are to challenge the students in the group who have some previous experience of programming.

          <h3>0. Before we start</h3>
          <p>Before we get going, you'll need some data and to know a key method - <code>loadStrings()</code>.
          <br/>
        So be sure to complete these two tasks first of all.<br/>
        They will ensure that you know how to use <code>loadStrings()</code>.</p>

      <div class="codeTask">
        <p><b>loadStrings() Example:</b></p>
        <p>
        We will be using a simple data file when live coding in the lecture - <a href="https://jsndyks.github.io/cityBootCamp/data/namesData.txt" target="_blank">namesData.txt</a><br/>
        So please <strong>download this data file in advance</strong>.
        You should right-click the link above to download and save a copy.<br/>
        It's important that you <strong>make sure you know where the file has been saved</strong> on your laptop.
      <br/>
        You can add the file to a <em>Processing</em> sketch by dragging it into the sketch code window.<br/>
        Data were generated through the <a href="https://www.mockaroo.com">mockaroo</a> Random Data Generator.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you have done so, open a new sketch and use <code>loadStrings("namesData.txt")</code> to load the contents of the file into an array of <code>Strings</code>s.<br/>
        Each line of the file will be loaded into an element of the array, in turn.</p>
        <p style="padding-bottom:1em">
        Try the following two-line sketch.
        It will load the file and print two of the array elements that have been loaded into the <code>lines</code> array.
      </p>
        <pre class="brush: processing; gutter: false; toolbar: false;">
          // Read a text file into an array names 'lines' with loadStrings()
          String[] lines = loadStrings("namesData.txt");

          // Print the number of lines loaded from namesData.txt into the lines array :
          println(lines.length);

          // Print the first String in the array to the console :
          println(lines[0]);

          // Print the second String in the array to the console :
          println(lines[1]);    </pre>
          <p>You should see this, and should be able to figure out how to show the other lines in the data file.</p>

        <p><b>Challenge - Update the Text File</b><br/>
        If you know how to edit a text file, then make some changes to the names, save the file and re-run the sketch, just to prove to yourself that the sketch is reading from a file on your computer.</p>

		  <h3>1. Introduction to data visualization</h3>

          <p>
						So far, most of the sketches you have built have involved creating some form of visual representation
						that you as a programmer have controlled (e.g. by putting numbers into your program code or asking <em>Processing</em>
						to generate random numbers for you), or you as a user have influenced (e.g. by moving the mouse or pressing
						keys).
					</p>

					<p>
						Data visualization is all about making graphical representations of data. These data are usually created
						externally, outside your program, and you write code to read those data into your program and show them
						graphically. The data can be of all sorts of things - daily temperatures, Twitter messages, Moodle usage stats, code commits, data generated in real time by sensors in the City or complex model outputs that might, for example, be predicting patterns of disease.
					</p>

					<p>
						Data can be turned into graphics in very different ways and for many different purposes. These range from
						more <b>artistic representations</b> with more focus on the visual and interactive design than the data that
						underlie them; more <b>communicative representations</b> where a story is be told using data; or more
						<b>scientific representations</b> that help investigate scientific questions in by assisting scientists in
						finding	patterns in data and relationships between datasets. Each of these will have different implications
						for visual design, but they all follow the same general pattern of transforming some form of dataset into
						some form of graphical depiction.
					</p>

					<h4>Examples</h4>

				  <p>
						The web has many, many creative visual representations of data. This is in part due to the popularity and
					  importance of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_data" target="_blank">Open Data</a> and because
						many of the various technologies that enable people to process this data - such as <em>Processing</em>.
            Other languages and programming frameworks are also common.
            Here are just a few examples of sites that contain interesting and informative data visualization:

          Have a look at <em>Fathom</em>'s <a href="https://fathom.info/yearinnikefuel/">Year in Nike Fuel</a> to see how personal data from activity trackers have been transformed into meaningful and revealing graphics through data visualization.

					<h3>2. Getting simple text data into a sketch</h3>
          <p>
						So how do we make a connection between the data we might want to visualize and our coding instructions?
						Thankfully <em>Processing</em> offers us several built-in methods for reading data, whether it comes from text files, activity trackers, remote databases or the Web.
					</p>

					<p>
						Perhaps the easiest to use is the <a href="http://processing.org/reference/loadStrings_.html" target="_blank">loadStrings()</a>
						method that reads in a text file into an array of <code>String</code>s. To see how it works, lets adapt the
						sketch from a few days ago that displays some names stored in an array:
					</p>

					</div></div>
          <div class="units-row">
            <div class="unit-70">   <!-- Row break ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ -->
					<pre class="brush: processing; gutter: false; toolbar: false;">String[] names;

void setup()
{
  size(300,580);
  fill(0);
  textSize(14);  // -- try changing the size of the text

  names = loadStrings("names.txt");
}

void draw()
{
  background(255);
  float yPos = 25;  // -- try changing the starting position on the Y axis

  for (String name : names)
  {
    text(name,20,yPos);
    yPos = yPos+28; // -- try changing the line by line vertical offset
  }
}</pre>
					<p>
						Notice that nowhere in the code is there any list of the actual names to display. Instead the <code>loadStrings()</code>
						method looks for a data file called <code>names.txt</code> that contains the actual names. Each line from this
						file is read into a separate element in an array that we've called <code>names</code> in this example.
            The <code>draw()</code> method then uses a for-each loop to iterate through this array, displaying each element one-by-one. So the output of our sketch is determined by the data. More names in the file, will give us more names on the canvas, with the same code.
					</p>

					<p>
						In order for <em>Processing</em> to know where to look to find the file <code>names.txt</code>, it needs to be created somewhere and then dragged into the <em>Processing</em> window.
            This will make a copy of the file in the <em>Processing</em> sketch.
					</p>
<!--  -->
					<div class="codeTask">
						<p>Try this code for yourself -- copy it into a sketch from above.</p>
            <p>Make sure you have a copy of <a href="https://jsndyks.github.io/cityBootCamp/data/names.txt" target="_blank">names.txt</a>
						(<i>right-click to save a copy</i>) and that you drag it into your <em>Processing</em> sketch code window.</p>

              <i>Hint:</i> You can find out how many names are in the list by using <code>names.length</code> that will report the

					<div class="units-row">
        <div class="unit-70">   <!-- Left column -->

          <p>
						Instead of a simple list of names, we can use the same approach to read in a larger text file. For example,
						<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org" target="_blank">Project Guttenberg</a> provides a repository for free
						electronic copies of thousands of books.
            We can use this repository as a source of data for our sketches.
            Below is a sketch that displays the contents of H.G. Wells' classic book '<em>The Time Machine</em>'
						<a href="https://jsndyks.github.io/cityBootCamp/data/theTimeMachine.txt" target="_blank">stored in a text file</a>.</p>
						<p>Each line of text in the file contains a whole paragraph and one line is displayed in the sketch at a time.
            You can change the line that is displayed interactively - use the '&lt;' and '&gt;' keys to display the book, one paragraph at a time.
            Clicking the 'space bar' will display line 10 - this is the first line of the content of the book - the title:

						The only element of this sketch that may be new is that we are using a slightly different version of <em>Processing</em>'s
						<a href="https://processing.org/reference/text_.html"><code>text()</code></a> method that takes 5 parameters — the text string to display, the position of the
						top-left of the text area and the width and height of the text area. When specified like this (i.e. as a rectangle),
						<em>Processing</em> will attempt to lay out the text, line by line, within the rectangle. This saves us having to update
						the position of each line as we did in the first example.
					</p>

					<p>
						The <code>keyPressed()</code> method handles skipping forward and backward using the '&lt;' and '&gt;' keys by
						updating the variable <code>lineToDisplay</code> with the array index corresponding to the
						currently displayed line.

					<h3>3. Extracting tokens from a line of text</h3>
          <p>
            The text that we have loaded so far is largely <i>unstructured</i>.
            While each line in the file is a line or paragraph of the book, and they are in the order in which they should be read, the text within the lines does not have any specific structure.
            But data are often, and most usefully, stored in text text files with more explicit structure.</p>
            <p>
            For example, each line may be a <em>record</em> about a thing that we are interested in, such as a day of the week.
            It may contain multiple pieces of information about the thing, such as your  maximum heart rate as recorded by an activity tracker.
            Here is an example text file that might be the basis of the <em>Year of NikeFuel</em> data visualization we saw above - <a href="https://jsndyks.github.io/cityBootCamp/data/hourlyBPM.txt" target="_blank">hourlyBPM.txt</a>. Each row is a day. Each line contains the name of the day and then 24 numbers that show maximum heart rate for each hour of the day:

          <p>
						We have seen that the <code>loadStrings()</code> method is very useful when you wish to read in lines of text into an array, line by line.
            But sometimes we may wish to go further than this and extract the individual elements <i>within</i>
						each line.
            For example, the words that make up a sentence or the numbers in the kinds of comma separated lists of numbers (or rows of numbers) shown above.
            These elements are often referred to as <i>tokens</i> and the process of extracting them as <i>parsing</i>.
					</p>

					<p>
						<em>Processing</em> provides a useful command to help with parsing tokens — <a href="http://processing.org/reference/split_.html" target="_blank">split()</a>.
						This method will take a string and a <i>separator</i> as parameters and split the text up into an array of
						smaller strings, using the separator character to divide the text.
					</p>

          <p>Read that sentence one more time!</p>

          <p>Let's say that again and take it slowly ...<br/>
            If a <i>String</i> (such as one that you load from a line of a text file) contains a series of characters that are separated by a <i>separator</i> (such as a comma), then <a href="http://processing.org/reference/split_.html" target="_blank">split()</a> will convert the <i>String</i> into an array containing each of the parts of the <i>String</i> that are separated by the <i>separator</i>.
          </p>

          <div class="codeTask">
            <p>Let's try a simple example.<br/>
              Load the following code into a new sketch and check the console to see the output from <code>println()</code>.</p>
              <p>Use the suggestions in the two <code>IDEA</code> comments to experiment and make sure you understand.</p>
          </div>
          <pre class="brush: processing; gutter: false; toolbar: false; highlight:[15];">// -- create a String:
String someText = "BootCamp is a fantastic experience";
// -- IDEA - try changing the String to contain different text ...

// -- Create an array containing the Strings that are the result of
// --   splitting the original String:
String [] splitText = split(someText,' ');
// -- IDEA - try changing the separator to 'a' or 'e' or somethign else ...

// -- Loop through each String in the array and print it to the console
// --   along with number of the array element:
for (int i=0; i&lt;splitText.length; i++) {
  println(i + "&lt; " + splitText[i]);
}</pre>

					<p>
            Now we can read lines of text from a file and split each line up into arrays we can use the contents of files to inform our sketches. So we have an array or lines, and an array of <i>tokens</i> for each line that splits the line contents according to a particular <i>separator</i>.</p>
          <p>Let's think about unstructured text first.
						As an example, suppose we wished to display each of the words of a sentence in different colours:

					<p>
						Here, the <i>separator</i> is the " " (i.e. a space), which is what we normally use to separate
						words from one another in a sentence. The returned result after calling the method is an array of <code>String</code>s,
						which in this example we have named as the array variable <code>tokens</code>. We then use a 'for-each' loop to iterate through
						that array, displaying each word in turn in a different random colour at a different vertical position.

					<h4>Extracting numeric values</h4>
          <p>
						The same principle can be used to extract numeric values from a line of structured text, like the ones we saw in the heart rate data above.
            As we have seen, numbers
						in a text file might be separated by commas rather than spaces, so it becomes a simple matter of passing a comma <code>","</code>
						rather than a space <code>" "</code> to the <code>split()</code> method.
					</p>

					<p>
						Here's an example that reads in a set of numbers representing daily temperatures and displays a series of
						rectangles that are sized according to the temperature of each day. Note that in this example (and the one
						above) we are assigning the value of the <code>textLine</code> variable explicitly within our code, but a
						real data visualization application is likely to read these values from a file using the approaches that we have already learned about.
					</p>
          <!--p>One important difference is that we have to convert the <code>String</code> into a floating point number, with <code>float()</code>.</p-->

					</div></div> <div class="units-row"><div class="unit-70">   <!-- Row break ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ -->
<pre class="brush: processing; gutter: false; toolbar: false; highlight:[20]">String textLine;

void setup()

				<p>
					The only command that may be new to you in this example is the use of a method called <code>float()</code>

						An obvious problem with the sketch is that the bar heights do not vary very much since we are representing
						the data (degrees Celsius) directly as pixel units (e.g. 19 degrees Celsius is shown as a rectangle 19 pixels
						high).
					</p>


					<p>
						It is quite common in data visualization to want to rescale data values so they match the sizes in pixel units
						we wish to use. We could achieve this by multiplying each data value (stored in the <code>temperature</code> variable
						above) by some value, say 4, so that 19 Celsius becomes 19*4 = 76 pixels tall. But a more general approach
						would be to use <em>Processing</em>'s <a href="http://processing.org/reference/map_.html" target="_blank">map()</a> command that rescales any number from one
						range to another:
					</p>

  size(400, 200);
  noStroke();
  fill(250, 110, 10);
  textLine = "14,16,18,19,19";    // Daily maximum tmperatures in the next 5 days.
}

void draw()
{
  background(255);
  float xPos = 30;

  String[] tokens = split(textLine, ",");

  for (String token : tokens)
  {
    float temperature = float(token);    // Convert text into a number.
    float barHeight = map(temperature,0,30, 1,160);
    rect(xPos, 20, 65, barHeight);
    xPos = xPos + 70;
  }
}</pre>

					<p>
						<code>map()</code> requires 5 parameters to be specified. The first is the number we wish to rescale. In the example above it
						is the value held in the <code>temperature</code> variable. The next pair of parameters are the minimum
						and maximum data values we can expect our data value to fall between.
            This is the <i>range</i> that we <i>map <b>from</b></i> or the <i>source</i> range.
            With UK temperatures, we will work
						on the assumption that our temperature range is between 0 and 30 degrees Celsius.
            The final pair of numbers
						represent the minimum and maxium rescaled values.
            This is the <i>range</i> that we <i>map <b>to</b></i> or the <i>target</i> range.
            In this case these values represent the number of pixels
						corresponding to the data minimum and data maximum respectively.

            <code><a href="https://processing.org/reference/beginShape_.html" target="_blank">beginShape()</a></code>, <code>endShape()</code> and <code>vertex()</code> for shapes that show hourly rates in a continuous curve.<br/>
            Remember to use transparent <code>fill()</code> colours by adding a fourth argument to <code>color(red, green, blue, opacity)</code>.<br/>
            This <em>alpha</em> channel specifies the <i>opacity</i>, and a transparent colour has a low alpha number.<br/>
            You will need to vary the colour for each day of the week (each line of the data file).

        <p>
					Let's bring together the three things we have been focussing on :</p>
          <ul>
            <li>reading of text files - <code>loadStrings()</code></li>
            <li>parsing of lines of text into tokens - <code>split()</code></li>
            <li>converting text strings into numbers - <code>float()</code></li>
            </ul>
          <p>We can do so with a data visualization example.<br/>
          Our example attempts to visualize data from the <a href="https://tfl.gov.uk/modes/cycling/santander-cycles" target="_blank">London Cycle Hire Scheme</a>.

				</p><p>
					Transport for London release some very large datasets that include the <a href="http://cycling.data.tfl.gov.uk/" target="_blank">times and places of all journeys
					made using the bikes</a>. This could be great source of data and ideas for your <code><b>#BootCamp</b></code> project.
            But for now we are going to use a simpler dataset that records how many bikes
					are docked at a series of docking stations at various points in time.
          The first few rows and columns of this table of data look like this:
        </p>
					<img src="https://jsndyks.github.io/cityBootCamp/images/formattedStationStatus.png" width="1530" height="427">

				<p style="padding-top:2em">
					Each row (apart from the first 'header' row) contains data about a particular bicycle docking station. It
					has its own unique numeric identifier, or ID (column 0); a name (column 1); a geographic location specified as a pair of
					Ordnance Survey map coordinates (columns 2 and 3); the number of bikes capable of being docked at the station
					(column 4); and then the number of bikes actually docked at the station at 30 minute intervals from midnight
					to midnight (columns 5 to the end).
				</p>

				<p>
					The full table can be downloaded as <a href="https://jsndyks.github.io/cityBootCamp/data/bikeShare.txt" target="_blank">bikeShare.txt</a>
					(right-click to download).
          Each bike station has its own line in the file and each value in every row is separated
					with a comma. This makes it an ideal format for reading with <code>loadStrings()</code> and parsing with
					<code>split()</code>.

          <h5>Bike Map</h5>
          <p>
						Rather than visualizing this information as a series of bars, we could use the location data for each docking station to produce a simple map.
            All we do here is plot a symbol for each station at a position on the canvas that is based upon the geographic information that we have read from the file.
            For example, we might show each station as a circle.
            We could make the size of the circle relate to the number of bikes that the station is capable of storing (its capacity):

					<p>
						Here we read in values from columns 2 and 3 representing the coordinates of each docking station. These
						numbers are Ordnance Survey grid coordinates at 1m resolution. To fit the data ontot he screen we need to translate them into locations on the canvas in pixels. The <code>map()</code> command for rescaling the numbers will do this for us. But to get the scaling right, we need to know the geographic range of
						our data is. Here we store this in the variables <code>NORTH</code>, <code>SOUTH</code>, <code>EAST</code>
						and <code>WEST</code>. These are the geographic extents of our data.

					<h3>5. Summary</h3>

          <p>You now have what you need to do some basic data visualization, and hopefully you can look back at the movies we introduced earlier and begin to imagine the kinds of data and the types of sketch and commands that may have been used to produce them. It's worth looking back and having a think about how these designs might have been implemented.</p>
          <p>The most important thing is that you know that:</p>
					<ul>
					<li>
						Data visualization is all about turning data into graphics.
					</li>
					<li>
						This usually involves reading from a data file and storing the data in variables so they can be used in your sketches.
					</li>
					<li>
						<em>Processing</em> contains a useful method for reading lines of text from a file — <code>loadStrings()</code>
					</li>
					<li>
						Elements within a line of text such as words or numbers can be <i>parsed</i> and extracted in <em>Processing</em> using
						the <code>split()</code> method.
					</li>
          <li>
						We can use <code>map()</code> to re-scale our data from the original numeric range of the data set to a range that allows us to create graphics by plotting shapes that represent the numbers in screen coordinates.
					</li>
        </ul>
          <p>If you do know these things, and you can use these methods and understand how to draw shapes with variables, then you are pretty much set - <b>the World is your Data Visualization oyster</b> ...</p>

          <p>Remember, that we expect you all to complete all of the <i>code tasks</i> and <i>core tasks</i>.</p>
          <p>Remember that we don't expect this to be straightforward. We expect you to experiment, use your debugging skills and to discuss solutions and approaches and problems and errors with student colleagues and teaching staff. You will recall what we learned last week: that if you want to be a good coder, you need to code, and the more you practice the easier it gets.</p>

          <h3>6. Reading</h3>
          <p>It's BootCamp - so there is no reading.</p>
          <p>But if you are interested in data visualization and want to find out more, we have a <b><a href="https://libraryservices.city.ac.uk/">library</a></b>, which has some excellent and sources - inspiring and informative.
          You'll find that quite a lot of the material is available online too!</p>

					<div class="challenge">
          <p>
              <b>Finding out More ...</b><br/>
 					  There are some fantastic books that explain approaches to designing <b>effective</b> data visualization.</p>
          <p>
					  You may wish to have a look at Isabel Meirelles lovely book on <a href="http://isabelmeirelles.com/book-design-for-information/" target="_blank">Design for Information</a>. It's full of exciting ideas and they are beautifully explained. You can get the whole thing <a href="http://tinyurl.com/yy9rtwgj">fully online</a> through the City library.
          </p>
          <p>
            A more comprehensive and scholarly coverage of approaches to information visualization is provided by Tamara Munzner in <a href="https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~tmm/vadbook/" target="_blank">Visualization Analysis and Design</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
					  There are multiple copies of both books available in the university library:
            </p><ul>
              <li><a target="_blank" href="https://library.city.ac.uk/record=b1906639">Meirelles (2013)</a></li>
