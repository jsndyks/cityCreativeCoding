				<h3>1. Computational Thinking</h3>

				<p>
					We hope you have found the <code>#CreativeCoding</code> a rewarding experience and one in which you feel you have made some progress, regardless of how much prior experience you have had with computing.
					We round off the lecture sessions by considering how you might use and develop your skills in
					<i>computational thinking</i>, so that as you progress through your degree you move from a 'coder' to a 'computer scientist'.
				</p>

				<p>
					In general terms, computational thinking can be considered a way of approaching problem solving in such a way that makes it easier for us to get computers to help us. And in that sense, what you have been doing in <code>#CreativeCoding</code> has been to practice doing exactly that. But perhaps more usefully we can break the concept down into a series of distinct ways of thinking:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li class="spacedList"><strong>Abstraction:</strong> The removal of the unnecessary details that describe a solution or a problem. For example, "Animate a ball moving across the screen" might be abstracted to "Draw a shape; update its position on each draw cycle". This can ease the process of <i>pattern matching</i> and <i>algorithmic thinking</i>. </li>
					<li class="spacedList"><strong>Decomposition:</strong> Break down a problem into a series of more easily solvable problems. For example in our Ball class, we separated the tasks of <i>drawing the ball</i>,
						<i>moving the ball</i>, <i>checking for collisions</i> into their own methods each of which we could work on independently.
					</li>
					<li class="spacedList"><strong>Pattern Matching:</strong> Applying the solution to one problem or class of problems to another.
						For example, creating a step sequencer (drum machine) by updating the triggering of sound
						samples just as we update the drawing of shapes in the 'draw()' cycle when animating.</li>
					<li class="spacedList"><strong>Algorithmic thinking:</strong> Applying logic and reasoning in the specification of a problem's solution. For example when you determined the code to change the direction of a ball to make it 'bounce' off the side of sketch window.</li>
					<li class="spacedList"><strong>Creativity:</strong> The ability to think more widely about the nature of a problem or solution and to come up with new and original ideas.
						This might involve combining approaches from very different contexts or re-specifying a task in different terms. We will see an example of creative thinking a little later in this lecture.
					</li><li class="spacedList"><strong>Understanding users and needs</strong>: Computing is a socio-technical discipline and you will be writing code to solve problems for other people. You will need to understand the user needs so that your software products can be used successfully by those users.</li>

				<p>
					Let's start with the <a href="https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/mod/page/view.php?id=968056" target="_blank">bouncing ball sketch</a> (right).
                    We'll stretch this beyond its original use by considering increasing the number of balls.
					To do this, we'll need a few minor changes, so that when there <i>are a lot of balls</i>...
				</p>

				<ul>
					<li class="spacedList">they are smaller (so they fit); </li>
					<li class="spacedList">they are slower (so we don't miss collisions of small balls); </li>
					<li class="spacedList">display the frame rate (so we can see the effect of adding balls on the speed of the sketch).
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					Another small change is that now the balls all start in the central area.
					As we'll see later, that leads to some interesting effects.
				</p>
				<hr class="hrInvisible"/>

				<div class="coreTask">
					<h5>How Many Balls?</h5>
					<p>Let's experiment ...</p>
					<ol>
						<li>Download
							<a href="https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/mod/resource/view.php?id=968101">bouncingBallsComplexity.zip</a></li>
						<li>unzip the sketch folder and run <code>bouncingBalls1</code></li>
						<li>Try increasing the variable <code>NBALLS</code> (the number of balls) in the main file a little</li>
						<li>Continue to do so until the sketch is no longer usable, no longer responsive - do so systematically, e.g by adding 0 to the number of balls: 100,1000,10000 etc.</li>
					</ol>
					<p>This version of the sketch also has a magnifier, which you can turn on by pressing a mouse button, for a better view of what is going on.</p>
					<ol start="5">
						<li>Record the number of frames per second in the top right of the sketch
							for each of your variations.
							<br/>We will use this information later for comparison purposes.</li>
					</ol> 
				</div>

				<p>
					We find that for very large numbers of balls (the number will depend on the particular machine
					used), the simulation grinds to a halt, and becomes very jerky.

				</p>

				<p>
					What has gone wrong? You should recall that, by default, <i>Processing</i> aims to call <code>draw()</code>
					60 times a second. If executing the code inside <code>draw()</code> takes longer than 1/60 of a
					second, there will be a noticeable slowdown, as we see here. I did some measurements on my computer,
					and got the following frame drawing times for different numbers of balls:
				</p>

				<figure>
					<script>loadImage('https://jsndyks.github.io/cityCreativeCoding/html/thinking/img/complexity1.png', 600, 600, 'Graph showing relationship between number of balls and framerate increasing geometrically');</script>

					<p>Graph showing relationship between <i>number of balls</i> and <i>framerate</i> <br/>
						<i>(click to enlarge)</i></p>
                </figcaption>
				</figure>


				<p>
					Ideally, for smooth animation we would like to see a frame rate of at least 30 frames per second
					(i.e. taking less than 33 milliseconds for each <code>draw()</code> cycle). But as you can see,
					beyond about 2000 balls, drawing becomes noticeably slow and by 20,000 balls, it takes a whole
					second just to draw a single frame.
				</p>

				<p>
					Your machine may be faster or slower, but that will affect the time scale consistently; the shape of
					the curve will be the same. The time for each <code>draw()</code> increases with the number of
					balls, but it's worse than that: the line isn't straight, so that the frame-drawing time increases
					faster than the number of balls does.

			<h4>2.1 Examining the Program</h4>

				<blockquote>
					<p>"Programmers waste enormous amounts of time thinking about, or worrying about, the speed of noncritical parts of their programs, and these attempts at efficiency actually have a strong negative impact when debugging and maintenance are considered.<br/>
					We <i>should</i> forget about small efficiencies, say about 97% of the time: premature optimization is the root of all evil.<br/>
					Yet we should not pass up our opportunities in that critical 3%."</br>
					<div style="text-align:right">(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Knuth">Donald Knuth</a>, 1974)</div></p>
				</blockquote>
			</div>
			<div class="unit-70-cc">
				<!-- Left column -->


				<p>
					It has often been observed that a small part of a program is typically critical for overall
					performance. We need to identify the part that is producing the curve in the above graph. Here is
					where we can start applying <i>algorithmic thinking</i> and a bit of <i>abstraction</i> so we can
					can direct our speeding up efforts to the relevant part of our code (<i>decomposition</i>).
				</p>

				<p>
					The program contains a class <code>Ball</code> describing a single ball, with methods to manipulate
					it:
				</p>

				<pre class="brush: processing; gutter: false; toolbar: false; ">class Ball {
  // fields (omitted)
		
  Ball()
  { ... }
		
  void draw()
  { ... }
		
  void move()
  { ... }
		
  boolean hasCollidedWith(Ball anotherBall)
  { ... }
		
  void bounce(Ball anotherBall)
  { ... }
}</pre>

				<p>
					There's quite a bit of code in some of these methods, but we should ask ourselves if there are any
					elements we can make faster. For example in Ball's <code>draw()</code> method we include a black
					stroke around each circle. Would removing it help speed things up?
				</p>

				<div class="coreTask">
					<h5>Speeding Things Up?</h5>
					<p>
					In your <code>bouncingBalls1</code> sketch, go to the <code>Ball</code> tab and try uncommenting the <code>noStroke()</code> line inside its <code>draw()</code> method.
					</p>
					<ul><li>What effect does this have on the speed of animation for various numbers of balls?</li></ul>
					<p>
						Again vary the number of balls as  you did with the first task above and compare the results. 
					</p>
					<ul><li>How much of an effect has this slight change to the sketch had?</li></ul>
				</div>

				<p>
					We can see the effect by measuring the frame times with and without the border around each ball for different numbers of balls:
				</p>

				<figure>
					<script>loadImage('https://jsndyks.github.io/cityCreativeCoding/html/thinking/img/complexity2.png', 600, 600, 'Graph showing relationship between number of balls and framerate increasing less sharply if ball outlines are omitted');</script>
				<figcaption>     
					<p>Graph showing relationship between <i>number of balls</i> and <i>framerate</i> under two sets of circumstances (with and without <i>stroke</i> being applied)<br/>
						<i>(click to enlarge)</i></p>
                </figcaption>
				</figure>

				<p>
					We have improved things in that we can now draw around 4000 balls before things start noticeably
					slowing. But importantly the shape of the curve is still worse than linear – as the number of balls
					increases, the time taken increases even more, even with this stroke adjustment.
				</p>

				<p>
					A key insight is that each call to one of the <code>Ball</code> methods takes a fixed amount of time
					no matter how many balls there are. So even if we reduce the time it does take to complete any of
					those methods, we will always show this worse-than-linear pattern as we increase the number of balls
					in the system.
				</p>

				<p>
					So we need to look at whether we can reduce the number of times we need to call any of these
					methods. The main program stars with variables and initialization:
				</p>

				<pre class="brush: processing; gutter: false; toolbar: false; highlight: [9]; ">int NBALLS = 100;
		
Ball[] balls;           // Declare an array of ball objects.
		
void setup()
{
  size(700, 700);
  balls = new Ball[NBALLS];
  for (int i=0; i &lt; balls.length; i=i+1)
  {
    balls[i] = new Ball();
  }
}</pre>

				<p>
					There is a loop here, but it is only executed once, when the sketch starts, and in any case the
					amount of work is proportional to the number of balls (i.e. it doesn't show that problematic upward
					curve we see in the charts above).
				</p>

				<p>
					That leaves the <code>draw()</code> method:
				</p>

				<pre class="brush: processing; gutter: false; toolbar: false; highlight: [6, 12, 15, 25]; ">void draw()
{
  background(254, 244, 232);  // Pale background.
		
  // First draw the balls in their current position.
  for (Ball ball : balls)
  {
    ball.draw();
  }
		
  // Check to see if any balls have collided
  for (int i = 0; i &lt; balls.length; i = i+1)
  {
    // Compare each ball with any untested others
    for (int j = i+1; j &lt; balls.length; j = j+1)
    {
      if (balls[i].hasCollidedWith(balls[j]))
      {
        balls[i].bounce(balls[j]);
      }
    }
  }
		
  // Finally move all the balls by one step.
  for (Ball ball : balls)
  {
    ball.move();
  }
}</pre>

				<p>
					The first and last loops go through all the balls, doing a bit of work for each. That means that the
					amount of work they do is again proportional to the number of balls (so not the cause of the
					slow-down problem). The middle loop is a different matter. It compares each ball with each other
					ball, to see if they have collided. That is, it does the following tests:

					It doesn't test any ball against itself, and each pair is only tested once. Although that cuts the
					number of tests in half, it is still proportional to <i>n</i>&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>, where <i>n</i> is
					the number of balls. <strong>This is the reason our performance curves upwards as <i>n</i> increases.</strong>
				</p>

				<p>
					Let's briefly consider how computer scientists (soon to be you!) describe these kinds of performance
					issues. It is a good example of <strong>abstraction</strong> as a form of computational thinking.

				<h4>2.2 Computational Complexity (Abstraction)</h4>

				<p>
					Over the decades, computer scientists have built an impressive body of knowledge about program
					performance.
				</p>

				<div class="tip">
					The <strong>complexity</strong> of a program is the relationship between its cost (running time, memory usage,
					etc.) and the size of its input.
				</div>

				<p>
					We often focus on of what happens for really large inputs, because that is where the problems
					usually arise.<br/>A side benefit is that we can often take a simplified view.
				</p>

				<p>
					For example, the following chart compares various performances in relation to input size.
				</p>

				<figure>
					<script>loadImage('https://jsndyks.github.io/cityCreativeCoding/html/thinking/img/complexity3.png', 600, 600, 'Graph showing relationship between number of balls and framerate increasing');</script>
				<figcaption>     
					<p>Graph showing relationship between <i>number of balls</i> and <i>framerate</i><br/>
						<i>(click to enlarge)</i></p>
                </figcaption>
				</figure>

				<p>
					One of the two orange straight-lines represents a program that takes twice as long as the other.
					That might be addressed by buying a faster computer. Similarly one of the curved lines represents
					twice as much time as the other.
				</p>

				<p>
					The key difference is between the straight-line curves, representing a cost proportional to
					<i>n</i>, and the curved ones, representing a cost proportional to <i>n</i>&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>. For
					large enough input sizes, the former will always win over the latter, no matter how fast our
					machines are. Thus we can often ignore constant factors, saying that the complexity functions belong
					to distinct classes:
				</p>

				<ul>
					<li class="spacedList">order <i>n</i> or O(<i>n</i>), also known as <strong>linear</strong> and </li>
					<li class="spacedList">order <i>n</i>&nbsp;<sup>2</sup> or O(<i>n</i>&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>), also known as
						<strong>quadratic</strong>.
					</li>
				</ul>

				<p>
					There are many more complexity classes. For example, the best known methods for some problems take
					time proportional to 2<sup><i>n</i></sup> (red line above). As you can probably see from the chart,
					such <strong>exponential</strong> time problems are infeasible for all but the smallest instances.
				</p>

				<p>
					So what we have done here is to apply <strong>abstraction</strong> to describing specific problem (our moving
					balls) to create a way of describing performance of any algorithm that relates input to output.

				<p>
					Let us return to the specific problem of bouncing balls. We have traced the performance issues with the bouncing balls program to the O(<i>n</i>&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>) collision tests, which result from testing each ball against every other ball.</p>
				<p> Our task is to reduce the number of these tests to
					O(<i>n</i>), i.e. proportional to the number of balls. We do not need to touch the test
					<code>hasCollidedWith()</code>, just call it less often. Nor need we touch the method
					<code>bounce()</code>, which is called on a collision.
				</p>

				<p>
					The key observation is that there is no point testing a ball for collision with one that is a long
					way away. To take advantage of this, we need to organize the balls according to their position in
					space.</p>
				<p>One simple way to do this is to impose a grid on the space, and collect together all the
					balls whose centre is in each square of the grid. To represent this, we can use a 2-dimensional
					array for the grid, with an <code>ArrayList</code> of <code>Ball</code>s at each square:
				</p>

				<pre class="brush: processing; gutter: false; toolbar: false; ">  ArrayList&lt;Ball&gt;[][] grid;
		</pre>

				<p>
					Using this structure, the new procedure to test for collisions is
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li class="spacedList">Clear the <code>grid</code></li>
					<li class="spacedList">Add each ball to the list in the grid square containing its centre </li>
					<li class="spacedList">For each ball, call <code>hasCollidedWith()</code> only with balls in the same or neighbouring
						grid squares. </li>
				</ol>

				<p>
					It seems very expensive to build all these lists on every iteration of <code>draw</code>, and it is:
					for moderate numbers of balls, this method is slower than the original implementation. However, the
					total work is still proportional to the number of balls <i>n</i>, so for large values of <i>n</i>,
					when the original becomes much slower, the new implementation is significantly faster:

				</p>

				<figure>
					<script>loadImage('https://jsndyks.github.io/cityCreativeCoding/html/thinking/img/complexity4.png', 600, 600, 'Graph showing relationship between number of balls and framerate increasing much less drastically when we apply our solution');</script>

				<div class="coreTask">
					<h5>An Algorithmic Approach</h5>
					<p>
					Run the <code>bouncingBalls2</code> (from the <a href="https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/mod/resource/view.php?id=968101">BouncingBallComplexity.zip</a> file you downloaded earlier).
					</p>
					<p>
					Again try changing the value of <code>NBALLS</code> with the values you used earlier, 
					to see how performance relates to the number of balls on your computer.</p>
					<p>Compare the results with your other two experiments.</p>
					<ul><li>What impact has this change had on sketch frame rate?</li></ul>
				</div>

				<p>
					This was a simplistic approach, but it was enough to fix the performance bottleneck.<br/>A more
					sophisticated approach might:
				</p>

				<ul>
					<li class="spacedList">try to reduce the work of regenerating the grid each time when by noting when balls remain
						within the same square (but note this is still a linear improvement, just like removing the
						border line around each ball, so it won't change the shape of the performance line, but simply
						its gradient). </li>
					<li class="spacedList">wrap the whole grid implementation in a class that hides most of the details and provides a
						high-level interface. An example is the giCentre's <a href="https://www.gicentre.net/utils/hashgrid">HashGrid</a> library.
						<!-- used in the 'soundballs' music-responsive balls shown earlier in the BootCamp. -->
						This won't reduce the algorithm's complexity (as defined above), but it may well make <i>pattern matching</i> easier by allowing us to recognise and use the approach in a range of applications.</li>

					Creative thinking isn't limited to the artistic side of computer science (such as those we
					considered on Monday), but is also an important part of the 'computational' side of Computer
					Science. Some of the most significant <a href="https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/Turing_Paper_1936.pdf" target="_blank">advances in the
						development of computer science</a> have resulted from creative thinking.
				</p>

				<p>
					Let's consider how we might apply some creative thinking to our collision complexity problem. We
					know that the quadratic complexity of the original bouncing balls sketch was because we were having
					to test every ball against every other one for a possible collision. Thinking creatively about the
					problem, we might try to sidestep the need to test for collisions in the first place.
				</p>

				<p>
					How might we do this? One way could be to simulate the space in which the balls move as though its
					was 3d, so that balls may pass 'in front' or 'behind' others without collision. It is important to
					note that we are not actually encoding 3d space, like we did in the previous session, but rather
					simulating a 3d effect. We could emphasise that effect by:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li class="spacedList">Making balls different sizes (smaller ones appear further away)</li>
					<li class="spacedList">Drawing the balls in size order to create impression of nearer ones in front of distant ones.
					</li>
					<li class="spacedList">Making smaller balls a darker colour, just like we did for the trees sketch last week</li>
					<li class="spacedList">Making the speed of each ball proportional to its size simulating rapid transit of balls closer
						to
						the observer.</li>
					<li class="spacedList">Stopping the balls bouncing off the side of the sketch to create the impression of a 'window'
						looking at a larger space.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					The code to do this is pretty straightforward and it both keeps the computational complexity of our
					sketch linear while adding an interesting perspective on our moving balls. The example to the right
					shows many thousand balls with a smooth frame rate.
				</p>

				<div class="coreTask">
					<h5>More Balls Please?</h5>
					<p>
					Run the <code>bouncingBalls3</code> - once again, this is in the <a href="https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/mod/resource/view.php?id=968101">BouncingBallComplexity.zip</a> file you downloaded earlier.
					</p>
					<p>
						Again try changing the value of <code>NBALLS</code> with the values you used earlier, 
						to see how performance relates to the number of balls on your computer.

				<h3>3. Structured Testing and Debugging </h3>

				<p>
					One thing we can guarantee happened to you during <code>#CreativeCoding</code> is that on some occasions your code didn't work as you expected it to.
					Perhaps you had some kind of error indicated by a red wavey line in <i>Processing</i> along with an error message.
					Perhaps when you ran your code, your sketch didn't appear.
					Perhaps it worked for most of the time but then did something unexpected.
					All of this is to be expected and experiencing it is part of the programming process, whether a beginner or experienced coder.

				<p>
					The act of identifying problems in your code and then resolving them, known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debugging" target="_blank">debugging</a>, is attributed to
					the early computer programmer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grace_Hopper" target="_blank">Grace Hopper</a>. As you progress through your degree you will continue to write
					code that needs debugging, but with careful computational thinking you will become more proficient
					and identifying and correcting the bugs in your code.
				</p>

				<blockquote>
					Debugging is like being the detective in a crime movie where you are also the murderer.
				</blockquote>

				<p>
					Let's look very briefly at some of the techniques you can put into practice to make 'solving'
					debugging mysteries a little easier.
				</p>

				<h4>3.1 Read Error Messages</h4>

				<p>It may seem obvious, but this is surprisingly often overlooked. If your programming environment is
					generating error messages, read them! In <i>Processing</i> this will be indicated with a red wavey line at
					or near the place in your code with a problem along with a red error message displayed in the
					console part of the interface.
				</p>

				<p>
					Error messages can immediately indicate the difference between forgetting semi-colons and exceeding
					the size of an array. Between trying to initialise a variable without declaring it and using
					<code>colour</code> rather than <code>color</code>. By applying <strong>pattern matching</strong> you will
					soon build up a set of common mistakes you can make and know what it is you need to do to correct
					them. By using <strong>abstraction</strong> you build up an intuition between different categories of error
					(e.g. 'compile-time' and 'run-time' errors) which leaves vital clues about how to correct them.
				</p>

				<h4>3.2 Generate Feedback</h4>

				<p>
					One of the common sources of difficulty when a program does not behave as expected is knowing where
					to look in your code to address the problem. This is especially the case with <i>run-time
						errors</i>, where the code compiles fine (no red wavey lines) but only when you run your sketch
					does something unexpected happen. This is where getting your program to provide you with feedback on
					how it is progressing can be useful.
				</p>

				<p>
					Some examples of feedback to support understanding how your program is (mis)behaving:
				</p>

				<ul>
					<li class="spacedList">Using <code>println()</code> to display the contents of variables, or the size of arrays</li>
					<li class="spacedList">Displaying values in your sketch using <code>text()</code> (e.g. frame count in the bouncing
						balls above)</li>
					<li class="spacedList">Slowing down the <code>frameRate</code> so you can follow how your sketch is changing on each
						redraw</li>
					<li class="spacedList">Using <i>Processing</i>'s <i>Debugger</i> (See the <code>Debug</code> menu and the <a href="https://processing.org/environment/#debug-1" target="_blank">Processing
							documentation</a>). This allows you to inspect the contents of all variables in your program
						and step though each line of code as it is executed when you run your sketch.</li>
					<li class="spacedList">Create <i>assertions</i> that describe what you expect your code to do and get the computer to
						inform you whether that is indeed the case (see below for an example of doing this).</li>
				</ul>

				<p>
					Gathering feedback in this ways allows you to apply <strong>decomposition</strong> to your program, isolating the individual components that you suspect might be the cause of your problem. In doing so it makes it much easier to apply <strong>algorithmic thinking</strong> to come up with a solution.
				</p>

				<h4>3.3 Test your Programs Systematically</h4>

				<p>
					Debugging can be especially challenging if your program works most of the time but occasionally
					fails or does something unpredictable. By testing your code systematically, that is,
					<strong>decomposing</strong> the possible cases your code may have to deal with, you can minimise the chances of being caught out by some unexpected behaviour.
				</p>

				<p>
					To see a fully worked through example of systematic testing see this page on <a href="https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/mod/page/view.php?id=968158" target="_blank">Unit Testing</a>.
					This combines a systematic approach to testing the behaviour of your <i>Processing</i> sketch with using
					feedback via <i>assertions</i>.
				</p>

				<p>
					A key part of systematic testing is to develop your intuition about the kinds of cases that are more likely to lead to errors. For example when coding a ball bouncing of the edge of a sketch window, testing to see what happens if the ball hits exactly the corner of the window. Building up knowledge of these <i>edge cases</i> that might apply to many programs requires you to <strong>decompose</strong> your code into smaller elements, to <strong>pattern match</strong> common causes of error and to <strong>abstract</strong> them in order to apply them in a range of scenarios.
				</p>

				<h4>3.4 Create Minimal Reproductions</h4>

				<p>
					Sometimes, despite going through many of the steps above, it may be that a bug defeats you. You
					cannot see what it is in your code that is leading to the unpredictable behaviour. In which case, you may need to seek help from others (note this should follow these other approaches, not be your first action).
				</p>

				<p>
					One important way of making it more likely that others will be able to help is to strip away all the bits of your code that you know don't contribute to the problem. In other words, try to make a version of your code as small as possible while still exhibiting the error you are trying to fix.</p>
				<p>
					Such a stripped-down version is known as a <a href="https://wizardzines.com/comics/minimal-reproduction/" target="_blank">minimal reproduction</a> or MR. It is very common that in the process of creating an MR, you end up spotting the problem. It can be seen as a form of <strong>abstraction</strong> where removing the unnecessary detail exposes the parts of your code that are more relevant to the debugging process.

				<h3>4. Summary</h3>

				<ul>
					<li class="spacedList">Computational thinking underlies much of what you have been doing in the last two weeks and will
						continue to develop during your degree. The key processes of <i>abstraction</i>,
						<i>decomposition</i>, <i>pattern matching</i>, <i>algorithmic thinking</i> and <i>creativity</i>
						provide a useful way for you to think about how you develop these computational thinking skills.
					</li>
					<li class="spacedList">
						Understanding how your code works, by writing it clearly, and abstracting key characteristics of
						it (like <i>computational complexity</i>) can save much time and expense while making the
						process of algorithmic thinking easier. During your degree you will develop many techniques to
						help you develop this skill.
					</li>

					<li class="spacedList">Learn to embrace <i>debugging</i> as part of thinking like a programmer. All programmers
						introduce bugs into their code as they write. Developing your computational thinking and
						structured testing skills will save many, many hours of frustration by reducing the
						opportunities to create bugs and speeding up the process of finding them.
					</li>

					<li class="spacedList">
						Try to apply your experience during <code>#CreativeCoding</code> within this framework of computational thinking so you can make the most of your Computer Science Degree with us at City!
