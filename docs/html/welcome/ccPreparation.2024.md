##### 1. Processing Setup

Download the latest version of _Processing_ from _The Processing Foundation_ :

- https://processing.org/download

##### 2. Dan Shiffman "Hello Processing" Activity

Spend **an hour** working your way through _Dan Shiffman's_ impressively enthusiastic, and very useful, introduction to _Processing_:

- https://hello.processing.org/

##### 3. Dear Data Reading and Tasks

Spend **an hour** or so looking at the _Dear Data_ materials that we provide and recommend.

Of course you could spend much more time on this, if it piques your interest than keep reading.

##### 4. Data Diary - Creative Thinking, Data Collection

Begin thinking about your _Dear Data Diary_ and perhaps start collecting some data.

##### 5. Moodle

Make sure that you have had a good look at these pages and checked the resources, including :

- the Reading List
- the Module Objectives

##### 6. Show Up for the Lecture on Tuesday

Use [MyTimetable](https://mytimetable.city.ac.uk/) to find out where and when.

Make sure that you have done all of the above and arrive :

- **early** - latecomers are disruptive to all
- **energised** - get some sleep, be ready to learn actively
- **imaginative** - we need creative thinking, problem solving
- **ready** - to try things out, learning through experimentation
