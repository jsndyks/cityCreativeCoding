                If you need a hand with this, be sure to connect with our <i>Teaching Assistants</i> (TAs) during one of the <i>drop-in sessions</i> that are scheduled in induction week.

                You will need to use the time before, between and after classes to work on the concepts that we introduce in lectures and labs. You will need this time to try things out, to check documentation, watch videos, be creative, fail, succeed and learn. Be sure to use your time at Uni well.</p>

                <p>Use <a href="https://mytimetable.city.ac.uk/">MyTimetable</a> to find out where and when <code>#CreativeCoding</code> lectures and classes are.</p>

                <p>Make sure that you have done all of the above and arrive :</p>
                <ul>
                <li><b>early</b> - latecomers are disruptive to all.</li>
                <li><b>energised</b> - get some sleep, be ready to learn actively</li>
                <li><b>imaginative</b> - we need creative thinking, problem solving</li>
                <li><b>ready</b> - to try things out, learning through experimentation</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Please don't chat or watch movies while in lecturers. This is distracting for everybody.<br/>
                   Please work to focus on the Computer Science that is being introduced, explained and discussed.<br/>
                   This won't always be easy - but you will need to find ways to focus, concentrate and engage in lectures to gain the knowledge and skills that you need to succeed in your degree.</p>

            <p><b>A note on 'latecomers':</b></p>
            <p>
                Please plan your time and activity to ensure that you are ready to learn when we start.
                Make sure that you are in the University 15 minutes before lectures start and ready to learn at 9:00am.<br/>
                This means that you are seated, quiet, have your laptop charged and open, Moodle open at the correct page, and your note-taking set-up ready to go!
                It is distracting and disrespectful to staff and fellow students to arrive during a lecture.<br/>
                When we are lecturing and we see a group arrive 15 minutes into the lecture we lose concentration as we rapidly think about how we can repeat the important stuff that we have already covered to ensure that those who have just arrived do not miss out on the narrative. We plan our lectures and teaching sessions to evolve ... for the middle bits and the end to make sense, well ... you need to be there from the start!<br/>
                It's really difficult when people show up mid-lecture. <br/>
                So, this is not a <i>complete ban</i> on late arrivals, but a <i>plea</i> to you to try to avoid this in light of the disruption that you may not have considered. <br/>
                Please plan to be at the lecture theatre well in advance of the start time - this is good for everybody: your lecturers, your fellow students and you.
