            <div class="unit-70">
            <p>At the start of <code>#BootCamp</code> you will be given a nice quality <i>notebook</i> with graph paper pages and a couple of <i>pens</i>. 
                These are to help you in <code>#BootCamp</code> and beyond.</p>
            <p>We want you to sketch ideas and take notes as this helps you think things through, plan your learning and work things out - and you are going to need to be good at all of these things to succeed in your degree.</p>
            <p>You also need to collaborate and communicate - get to know people and work with them. So share your coloured pens with others in the class if you need more colours. Hunt around - find somebody who has the green that you need.
                See if you can make a ðŸŒˆ through some cross-class collaboration - you'll get to meet a few of your colleagues.</p>
            <p>Members of teaching staff will not always be right there when you need them - so make structured notes and jot down questions, reactions, ideas that you can refer to when they come by, or when they are available. Your notes can be digital or physical - but make sure that you know where they are and how to access them when the teachers are around to discuss your work with you.</p>
            </div>

                <img src="https://jsndyks.github.io/cityBootCamp/html/welcome/img/notebook.IMG_1510.jpeg" width="200" /><br/>
                <p>You should have one of these - and a couple of pens.<br/>Please use them!</p>
                <p>If you don't have a notebook and pens, then contact the Programmes Office.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

            <div class="unit-70">
            <p>The <i>notebook</i> has something  like 240 pages in it.</p>
            <p>During your degree, you will attend about 240 lectures.</p>
            <p><code>#BootCamp</code> is a little different, but the usual rhythm is 4 lectures per module per week, 10 weeks per term, two full terms of modules over a three year degree - something like that. It looks a bit like this ðŸ‘‰.</p>
            <p>So the picture is a visual representation of your degree. And so is the <b>notebook</b> - one page per lecture, and a good place, perhaps to make notes, log your progress.</p>
            <p>Now is a good time to think about how you will progress through to the bottom right, because it will happen quite quickly.
                <ul>
                    <li>How many of these lectures will you attend?</li>
                    <li>What will you do during them to make the most of them?</li>
                    <li>What will you do after and between them?</li>
                    <li>Who will you need to know and what resources will you need to use to learn effectively from them?</li>
                </ul>  
            <p>Now, I would not get too caught up in the notebook / degree metaphor, and we will certainly neither expect nor collect full notebooks at the end of your course.
                But taking good notes, being organised about your learning, and thinking about what you need to put into your time as a student to succeed, and how much time that is, is a good idea at the outset.

                <p>So, how will you participate during lectures at City?<br/>What will you do in class?</p>
                <p>It surprises me that some students seem to think that just sitting there will somehow give them the knowledge that they need.
                   <b>It doesn't</b> - you need to think, answer questions, code and take notes. You need to engage and act and enquire to learn.</p>

                <p>
                The <a href="https://medium.goodnotes.com/study-with-ease-the-best-way-to-take-notes-2749a3e8297b">Cornell Notes</a> method for note-taking in lectures is worth considering.<br/>
                The approach has helped some students in the past and seems useful to me.</p>
                
                <p>It is explained in two short videos on the <a href="https://lsc.cornell.edu/how-to-study/taking-notes/cornell-note-taking-system/">The Cornell Note Taking System</a>. They are worth a look.</p>
                
                <p>Now <code>#BootCamp</code> lectures are a little different to some other lectures, and you will have laptops out and are likely to be dealing with short introductions to self-paced activity in many cases. But taking notes like this in lectures will give you some pointers for activity and discussion in the labs, and subsequently in your own time. We do have time scheduled for discussion in the labs and through the online channels, through which we can explore the concepts, and issues introduced in the lectures.</p>

                <p>So - take structured notes, and figure out a good way to do this so that you participate actively and effectively in lectures.
                    How might you structure not-taking, the layout of your notes pages, for <code>#BootCamp</code>?<br/>
                    Your teachers and classmates can advise you - and you can likely advise them.<br/>
                    You may want to use your notebooks - for <code>#BootCamp</code> at any rate.

            <p>I asked some former students who survived <code>#BootCamp</code> what their advice would be for anybody about to start the course.<br/>
            Here is their guidance and feedback for you:</p>
            <blockquote style="margin-bottom:0.25em">Start to learn the <b>main concepts of conditions</b> early on in BootCamp:<br/><code>if</code>, <code>while</code>, <code>do ... while</code>, <code>for</code> loops.<br/> This helps immensely in most of the coursework related to Java</blockquote>
            <p style="padding-bottom:2em;padding-top:0px;margin-top:0.25em; padding-left:4em">... and get a hand from teaching staff if you find these concepts challenging.</p>
            <blockquote style="margin-bottom:0.25em">Try to grasp the notion of <b>classes</b> and <b>objects</b>, but donâ€™t worry if you can not, as this is taught several times during the first year.</blockquote>
            <p style="padding-bottom:2em;padding-top:0px;margin-top:0.25em; padding-left:4em">... once again, discuss these concepts with staff as we work through week 1.</p>
            <blockquote style="margin-bottom:0.25em">If you already have experience of coding then some of BootCamp will seem very simple but its always good to get practice in and <b>try to challenge yourself</b> on some of the tasks. There are always ideas for taking things further - maybe add a new feature or additional aspects to the sketch you are working on.</blockquote>
            <p style="padding-bottom:2em;padding-top:0px;margin-top:0.25em; padding-left:4em">... if you know how to code, just have fun coding new stuff and seeing what <i>Processing</i> and its libraries can do - look for the red 'challenges' to guide you.</p>
            <blockquote style="margin-bottom:0.25em">To students who don't have experience with coding don't focus too much on getting the math calculations perfect like the size of a shape to be exactly like in the example and focus on <b>understanding what the code is doing and how it works</b>.</blockquote>
            <p style="padding-bottom:2em;padding-top:0px;margin-top:0.25em; padding-left:4em">... yes, we do not need you to copy what we have done exactly. Focus on understanding the concepts and not the detail of replication.</p>
            <blockquote style="margin-bottom:0.25em">Take time to understand how to read the <i>Processing</i> documentation as being able to read documentation is a very important skill which I felt wasn't really taught. Get a hand with this too! This is especially the case for those who don't have coding experience it often looks like a whole load of gibberish. Students who don't take the time to look and break it down will not be able to use all of this functionality.</blockquote>
            <p style="padding-bottom:2em;padding-top:0px;margin-top:0.25em; padding-left:4em">... the <a href="https://processing.org/reference/"><i>Processing</i> reference material</a> is an essential source, so please take this advice and take time to explore and understand it. As ever, teachers online and in class can help you make sense of this.</p>

                <p>Of course, computers can do all sorts - they can problem solve, find information and write code for you very effectively.</p>
                <p>OpenAI's <a href="https://chat.openai.com/chat">ChatGPT</a> is very good at writing <i>Processing</i> sketches as you will discover if you try it out or watch the <a href="https://cityuni-my.sharepoint.com/:v:/g/personal/j_dykes_city_ac_uk/EccRuu5vIRBGqzXAOsAv3HQBybcV6pLSINqvHj_L2nDjdQ?nav=eyJyZWZlcnJhbEluZm8iOnsicmVmZXJyYWxBcHAiOiJPbmVEcml2ZUZvckJ1c2luZXNzIiwicmVmZXJyYWxBcHBQbGF0Zm9ybSI6IldlYiIsInJlZmVycmFsTW9kZSI6InZpZXciLCJyZWZlcnJhbFZpZXciOiJNeUZpbGVzTGlua0RpcmVjdCJ9fQ&e=U6dFbD" target="_new">AI at BootCamp</a video to the right ðŸ‘‰.</p>
                <p>But we'd like you to try to complete the tasks and solve the challenges without using AI please. 
                    Doing so will give you the skills and outlook that you require to solve more complex challenges as you move through your course.
                    We need to know that you have a grounding, a foundation in the kind of creative computing that we are focussing on here.</p>
                  <p>So let's keep the AI out of <code>#BootCamp</code> - we have plenty of use for it, and to learn about it as we go through the course, but you will only succeed in the course if you have the skills and experience that we are trying to give you in year 1. 
                    And that requires you to take the time to complete these task and exercises, think them through, get them wrong, understand them and painstakingly type the code that is required to do this.</p>
                    <p>So, once again - <b> keep the AI out of <code>#BootCamp</code> if you want to learn the essentials of coding</b>.<br/>
