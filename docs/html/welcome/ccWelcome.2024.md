<p>
<i>Creative Coding</i> is a term-long programming experience designed for both completely new and experienced programmers.
We will start from the very basics of programming and gradually move into interesting, applied programming such as digital art and data visualization.
</p>

<p>We will essentially teach you _Java_, but rely on an environment called <b>Processing</b> â€“ that will introduce key programming concepts and enable you to create interactive, graphical, animated applications with much less effort than regular Java.</p>

<p><i>Creative Coding</i> is <b>not assessed</b>.
But engaging fully will give you experience, knowledge and skills that will provide important grounding and contribute to your future studies.

As you start life at University, we want to give you some freedom to experiment and play with programming and show you the cool stuff it lets you do in a zero risk environment.
We also want you get to know us and your colleagues, and get used to University life through this activity.
Most importantly, we want you to <b>have some fun</b> with a shared data and coding experience in your first term.</p>

    <p style="color:#933"> <b><u>Important:</u></b> On Tuesday we plan to hit the ground running.<br/>
    We expect you to bring charged laptops to the lecture with Processing installed.<br/>

We expect you to have completed the [Creative Coding Preparation]() activities.

<p>*Finding rooms on campus is an acquired skill! Refer to the image below and the following rule:
    the first letter of the room tell you what building you should head to (ex: A = College Building),
    the next number or characters tell you the floor (ex: LG = lower ground; G = ground; 1 = first floor),
    and the rest are the number of the room on that floor. Good luck!</p>
