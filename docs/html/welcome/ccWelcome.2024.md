<p>Our <code>#CreativeCoding</code> activity begins ...<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on <b>Tuesday, 1st October at 9am</b> in <b>A132, The Great Hall</b>.</p>

<p>Remember to check <a href="https://mytimetable.city.ac.uk/">MyTimetable</a> to find the rooms in which subsequent <code>#CreativeCoding</code> tutorial sessions take place.</p>

<p>
<code>#CreativeCoding</code> is a term-long programming experience designed for both completely new and experienced programmers.<br/>
We will start from the very basics of programming and gradually move into interesting, applied programming such as digital art and data visualization.

<p>Remember your <i>Fib Friend Badge</i> - find a couple of people with the same code and share something meaningful about yourself with them ... and talk about University, <code>CreativeCoding</code> and fun stuff.</p>

<hr/>

<p>In <code>#CreativeCoding</code> we will essentially learn <i>Java</i>, and this is a great introduction to the language, But we will rely on an environment called <b>Processing</b> â€“ that will introduce key programming concepts and enable you to create interactive, graphical, animated applications with much less effort than regular Java.</p>

<p><code>#CreativeCoding</code> is <b>not assessed</b>.
But engaging fully will give you experience, knowledge and skills that will provide important grounding and contribute to your future studies.
As you start life at University, we want to give you some freedom to experiment and play with programming and show you the cool stuff it lets you do in a zero risk environment.
We also want you get to know us and your colleagues, and get used to University life through this activity.
Most importantly, we want you to <b>have some fun</b> with a shared data and coding experience in your first term.</p>

<p>At the end of term, your tutors will provide a short report on your <code>#CreativeCoding</code> activity that they may use in subsequent reference writing: a <b>Creative Coding Commentary</b> that will report on your initiative, participation, creativity, group-work capability in <code>#CreativeCoding</code> and the tutorials </p>

<p><b>Important:</b> On Tuesday we plan to hit the ground running.</p>

<ul>
<li>We expect you to bring <b>charged laptops</b> to the lecture with <i>Processing</i> installed.</li>
<li>We expect you to have <b>completed the preparation</b> beforehand - the <code>#CreativeCoding</code> Preparation Activities, the Dear Data Diaries work and the GitHub setup are essential preparation</li>
</ul>
<p>Details follow ...</p>
