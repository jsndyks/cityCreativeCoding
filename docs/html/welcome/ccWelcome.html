            <p>At the start of <code>#CreativeCoding</code> you will be given a nice quality <i>notebook</i> with graph paper pages and a couple of <i>pens</i>. 
                These are to help you in <code>#CreativeCoding</code> and beyond.</p>
            <p>We want you to <i>sketch ideas</i> and <i>take notes as you learn</i> as this helps you think things through, plan your learning and work things out.
                You are going to need to be good at all of these things to succeed in your degree.</p>
            <p>You also need to <i>collaborate</i> and <i>communicate</i> - get to know people and work with them.
                So share your coloured pens with others in the class if you need more colours. Hunt around - find somebody who has the green that you need.
                See if you can make a 🌈 through some cross-class collaboration - you'll get to meet a few of your colleagues.</p>
            <p>Members of teaching staff will not always be right there when you need them - so make structured notes and jot down questions, reactions, ideas that you can refer to when they come by, or when they are available. Your notes can be digital or physical - but make sure that you know where they are and how to access them when the teachers are around to discuss your work with you.</p>
            </div>

                <p>You should have one of these - and a couple of pens.<br/>Please use them!</p>
                <p>If you don't have a notebook and pens, then contact the Programmes Office - call in to <b>A302</b> to pick up your <code>#CreativeCoding</code> kit.</p>

            <p>The <i>notebook</i> has something  like 240 pages in it.</p>
            <p>During your degree, you will attend about 240 lectures.</p>
            <p><code>#CreativeCoding</code> is a little different, but the usual rhythm is 4 lectures per module per week, 10 weeks per term, two full terms of modules over a three year degree - something like that. It looks a bit like this 👉.</p>
            <p>So the picture is a visual representation of your degree. And so is the <b>notebook</b> - one page per lecture, and a good place, perhaps to make notes, log your progress.</p>
            <p>Now is a good time to think about how you will progress through from the top left, where we are right now, through to the bottom right.
                Because it will happen quite quickly. And you need to use the time and opportunity well.
                <ul>
                    <li>How many of these lectures will you attend?</li>
                    <li>What will you do during them to make the most of them?</li>
                    <li>What will you do after and between them?</li>
                    <li>Who will you need to know and what resources will you need to use to learn effectively from them?</li>
                </ul>  
            <p>Now, I would not get too caught up in the notebook / degree metaphor, and we will certainly neither expect nor collect full notebooks at the end of your course.
                But taking good notes, being organised about your learning, and thinking about what you need to put into your time as a student to succeed, and how much time that is, is a good idea at the outset.

                <p>So, how will you participate during lectures at Uni?<br/>What will you do in class?</p>
                <p>It surprises me that some students seem to think that just sitting there will somehow give them the knowledge that they need.
                   <b>It doesn't</b>. You need to think, answer questions, code and take notes. You need to engage and act and enquire to learn.</p>

                <p>
                The <a href="https://medium.goodnotes.com/study-with-ease-the-best-way-to-take-notes-2749a3e8297b">Cornell Notes</a> method for note-taking in lectures is worth considering.<br/>
                The approach has helped some students in the past and seems useful to me.</p>
                
                <p>It is explained in two short videos on the <a href="https://lsc.cornell.edu/how-to-study/taking-notes/cornell-note-taking-system/">The Cornell Note Taking System</a>. They are worth a look.</p>
                
                <p>Now <code>#CreativeCoding</code> lectures are a little different to some other lectures, and you will have laptops out and are likely to be dealing with short introductions to self-paced activity in many cases. But taking notes like this in lectures will give you some pointers for activity and discussion in the labs, and subsequently in your own time. We do have time scheduled for discussion in the labs and through the online channels, through which we can explore the concepts, and issues introduced in the lectures.</p>

                <p>So - take structured notes, and figure out a good way to do this so that you participate actively and effectively in lectures.
                    How might you structure note-taking, the layout of your notes pages, for <code>#CreativeCoding</code>?<br/>
                    Your teachers and classmates can advise you - and you can likely advise them.<br/>
                    You may want to use your notebooks - for <code>#CreativeCoding</code> at any rate.

                <p>When <code>#CreativeCoding</code> appears on the timetable, we will <i>usually</i> have two hours together in class to introduce and discuss key topics.</p>
                <p>Make sure you are seated before the time that the lecture is scheduled to start.
                    Be sure to have your laptops open and ready as we will be trying out coding tasks during the lectures.
                    Find the Moodle page for the lecture before things begin as you may need to follow links, copy code and download data.</p>
                <p>After (or sometimes before) the lectures, you will have a <i>Practical Class</i> scheduled, led by one of our <i>Teaching Assistants</i> (TAs).</p>
                <p>But, you will not complete all of the <code>#CreativeCoding</code> work in as single hour - there is more to do than this.</p>
                <p>We expect you to spend 3 or 4 hours outside of the lectures completing the exercises, following links, checking documentation, discussing progress, etc.
                    And we recommend that you do so predominantly <i>on the day of the lecture</i> or <i>as soon afterwards as you are able</i>.
                    <br/>We actually encourage you to work through the notes and try the tasks <i>before the lecture</i> if you are able to do so.
                </p>
                <p>Your practical classes are not always scheduled immediately after the lecture, so we strongly recommend that you work on the <code>#CreativeCoding</code> activity before, after and around the practical class. This means that you can come to class prepared to discuss your progress, efforts, plans and attempts to solve the tasks with our teaching staff.</p>
                <p>Put time in your diary around the class to make the most of the materials, and the classes.</p>

                <p>Much of the learning you do at University can be approached in the same way - and we'd like you to think about this right at the outset, in <code>#CreativeCoding</code>.</p>
                <p>Let's imagine you are completing one of the tasks that we set.<br/>We'd like you to think about <b>PAROT Talk</b>!</p>
                <p>Yeah, that's right ... we want you to 🦜.</p>
                <p>Now, learning <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/parrot_fashion">Parrot Fashion</a> involves learning ...</p>
                <blockquote>In the manner of a parrot;<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with thoughtless repetition of what others have said<br/><a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/parrot_fashion">Wiktionary (2024)</a></blockquote>
                <p>But we are asking you to put effort into doing <b>the very opposite</b> of that.<br/>
                We would like you to ... <i>plan</i>, <i>attempt</i>, <i>run</i>, <i>observe</i>, <i>think</i> and then perhaps <i>talk</i>, before doing the same thing again in a progressive learning cycle: <b>PAROT Talk</b></p>
                <p>In completing a small <code>#CreativeCoding</code> coding task, you might ... </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="parotTalk">P</span><span class="parotTalkSm">lan</span> -  your approach, with some sketches and thinking about what you are trying to achieve, and what your approach may be</li>
                    <li><span class="parotTalk">A</span><span class="parotTalkSm">ttempt</span> - to solve the problem based upon this planning, for example by writing some carefully considered and fully documented code</li>
                    <li><span class="parotTalk">R</span><span class="parotTalkSm">un</span> - the approach, try it out, for example in <i>Processing</i> by clicking the 'run' button</li>
                    <li><span class="parotTalk">O</span><span class="parotTalkSm">bserve</span> - what happened? Was it what you expected, or something else?<br/>Watch carefully, check any debug messages, and any reporting that you have added to the approach (if you didn't add any at first, add these to your plan next time).</li>
                    <li><span class="parotTalk">T</span><span class="parotTalkSm">hink</span> - can you explain what happened, why things went wrong (if they did)?<br/>How does reflecting deeply on your attempt and subsequent observation inform your planning for next time?<br/>What have you learned?<br/>What do you not understand?</li>
                    <li><span class="parotTalk">Talk</span> - communicate with colleagues by explaining your thinking, showing them your attempt and gaining alternative and perhaps even diverse perspectives.<br/>Talk to your teachers, electronically or in person. Check any documentation.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>... and then start another cycle until the ask is complete.</p>

                <p>We would like you to try this when you undertake <code>#CreativeCoding</code> tasks.<br/> For example: <i>copy this code</i>, into a <i>Processing</i> sketch and <i>run</i> it.<br/>
                    Change the five global variables that control the way in which the sketch changes over time.<br/>
                    Every time you make a change, go through a PAROT (talk) cycle, and if things did not turn out as you expected, go again into cycle two.<br/>
                    Several cycles should help you understand what  each of the global variables do, and how the <i>Processing</i> <code>rect()</code> and <code>frameRate()</code> methods work and how the <code>mouseX</code>, <code>mouseY</code> and <code>frameCount</code> variables vary.</p>
 

<pre class="brush: processing; gutter: false; toolbar: false; highlight: [4,5,6,7,8] ">// -- global variables : Change these FIVE in turn, and in combination.
// -- Use PAROT talk to learn their effects.
                    
float mouseXDiv = 1;           // &lt;-- change number that mouseY is divided by
float mouseYDiv = 1;           // &lt;-- change number that mouseX is divided by
float rectRatio  = 0.5;        // &lt;-- change the aspect ratio of the rectangle
float widthFactor = 2;         // &lt;-- change the speed at which the rectangle changes size
float framesPerSecond = 60;    // &lt;-- change frameRate from 1-60
                    
                    
void setup() {
  size(400, 300);
  background(255, 236, 149);  // &lt;-- change each of the colour components between 0 and 255
  fill(203, 118, 122);        // &lt;-- change each of the colour components between 0 and 255
}
                    
                    
void draw() {
  frameRate(framesPerSecond);  // -- sets number of frames per second.
                    
  // -- calculate position and dimensions of rectangle depending on global variables:
  float x = mouseX / mouseXDiv;
  float y = mouseY / mouseYDiv;
  float rectWidth = frameCount / widthFactor;
  float rectHeight = rectWidth * rectRatio;
                    
  // -- draw a rectangle at x,y with the specified height and width:
  rect(x, y, rectWidth, rectHeight);
}</pre>
<p>We think that you can usefully apply this reflective approach to learning at various scales at University: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>completing a small section of a programme</li>
        <li>completing a larger programme</li>
        <li>undertaking an assessment (and receiving feedback)</li>
        <li>taking a whole module</li>
        <li>completing a year of your course</li>
        <li>your whole degree?<i>Maybe, if you go on to do another one?</i></li>
        <li>life? <i>Now we are getting philosophical</i>!</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We encourage you to adopt <b>PAROT Talk</b>, or something similar, as you are experimental, reflective and systematic in your learning.</p>

                <h4>#BootCamp</h4>
                <p><code>#CreativeCoding</code> is based on the materials and approaches used in our <code>#BootCamp</code> activity. For many years we have run a two-week intensive introduction to coding at the start of year 1. But we have changed things a little this time as we redesign our learning activities. <code>#BootCamp</code> as intensive, perhaps <i>too intensive</i>, and we didn't like the lack of time, the negativity around the term, and the lack of clearly defined outputs.</p>
                <p>Nevertheless, our <code>#BootCamp</code> experiences, and those of former <code>#BootCamp</code> students are worth considering as we begin to learn through <code>#CreativeCoding</code>.</p>
                <p>We asked some former students who survived <code>#BootCamp</code> what their advice would be for anybody about to start the course.<br/>
                Here is their guidance and feedback for you:</p>
                <blockquote class="adviceToStudents">
                    Start to learn the <b>main concepts of conditions</b> early on in the course:<br/><code>if</code>, <code>while</code>, <code>do ... while</code>, <code>for</code> loops.<br/> This helps immensely in most of the coursework related to Java
                </blockquote>
                <p style="padding-bottom:2em;padding-top:0px;margin-top:0.25em; padding-left:4em">
                    ... and get a hand from teaching staff if you find these concepts challenging.
                </p>

                <blockquote class="adviceToStudents">
                    Try to grasp the notion of <b>classes</b> and <b>objects</b>, but don't worry if you can not, as this is taught several times during the first year.
                </blockquote>
                <p style="padding-bottom:2em;padding-top:0px;margin-top:0.25em; padding-left:4em">
                    ... once again, discuss these challenging but important concepts with staff as we work through week 1.
                </p>

                <blockquote class="adviceToStudents">
                    If you already have experience of coding then some of the concepts and exercises will seem very simple but its always good to get practice in and <b>try to challenge yourself</b> on some of the tasks. There are always ideas for taking things further - maybe add a new feature or additional aspects to the sketch you are working on.

                    ... if you know how to code, just have fun coding new stuff and seeing what <i>Processing</i> and its libraries can do - look for the red 'challenges' to guide you.

                <blockquote class="adviceToStudents">
                    To students who don't have experience with coding don't focus too much on getting the math calculations perfect like the size of a shape to be exactly like in the example and focus on <b>understanding what the code is doing and how it works</b>.

                <blockquote class="adviceToStudents">
                    Take time to understand how to read the <i>Processing</i> reference documentation as being able to read documentation is a very important skill which I felt wasn't really taught. Get a hand with this too! This is especially the case for those who don't have coding experience it often looks like a whole load of gibberish. Students who don't take the time to look and break it down will not be able to use all of this functionality.

                <h4>#CreativeCoding</h4>

                <p>Recently, we re-branded and re-scheduled <code>#BootCamp</code> as <code>#CreativeCoding</code> and we asked last year's students to offer advice to this year's students when they had completed the activity.<br/>
                    Here is some useful advice that those who took <code>#CreativeCoding</code> last year offered to you folks:</p>
    
                <blockquote class="adviceToStudents">
                <b>Just do it.</b></br>
                How you do something is how you do everything. If you start of being lazy with this and thinking it is boring, that says more about you that it does about the task.<br/>To paraphrase David Foster Wallace: <i>The key to life and success is to be unborable</i>.
                </blockquote>
                <p style="padding-bottom:2em;padding-top:0px;margin-top:0.25em; padding-left:4em">
                    ... a nice point - we try our best to inspire and enthuse you, but how exciting and enabling this is, is really down to you.
                </p>

                <blockquote class="adviceToStudents">
                <b>I KNOW IT IS NOT ASSESSED BUT!</b><br/>
                <i>Put in the effort</i>. The same amount you would in any other assessed module.<br/>
                The critical thinking skills are equally as important, and so are the connections you will make with your fellow coders when doing this project.<br/>
                Also, don't think that you &quot;<i>have time</i>&quot; later. Before you know it, it's going to be the end of the first term, and you still haven't collected any data! So start now, start small, stay consistent.<br/>
                I promise you that you will see the difference in a couple of months' time when you are programming in other languages.
                </blockquote>
                <p style="padding-bottom:2em;padding-top:0px;margin-top:0.25em; padding-left:4em">
                    ... we're convinced that engaging with <i>Processing</i> now helps with coding later - that's why we put so much effort into <code>#CreativeCoding</code>.
                </p>
    
                <blockquote class="adviceToStudents">
                Spend as much time as you can <b>playing around</b> with <i>Processing</i>'s different features that can be found in the processing docs.<br/>
                I ended up doing a lot of the stuff a week before it was taught to us through scouring the docs and seeing what I could do.

                <p style="padding-bottom:2em;padding-top:0px;margin-top:0.25em; padding-left:4em">
                    ... the materials are released in advance, so you can come to each session knowing how to use the concepts introduced.
                </p>
    
                <blockquote class="adviceToStudents">
                <b>Do the reading and the data collection ahead of time</b>.
                    That will give you plenty of time to get ideas on how to execute it later on. And do something you like. Even video games have an insane amount of data to analyse.

                <p>I made this a couple of years ago, and <a href="https://chat.openai.com/chat">ChatGPT</a> has not become any worse at computer programming since then!</p>
                <p><b>But we'd like you to try to complete the tasks and solve the challenges <i>without using AI</i> please. </b></p>
                  <p>Doing so will give you the skills and outlook that you require to solve more complex challenges as you move through your course.
                    We need to know that you have a grounding, a foundation in the kind of creative computing that we are focussing on here.</p>
                  <p>So let's keep the AI out of <code>#CreativeCoding</code> - we have plenty of use for it, and to learn about it as we go through the degree course, but you will only succeed in the wider degree if you have the skills and experience that we are trying to help you establish in year 1.<br/> 
                    And that requires you to take the time to complete these task and exercises, think them through, get them wrong, understand them and painstakingly type the code that is required to do this.</p>
                    <p>So, once again - <b> keep the AI out of <code>#CreativeCoding</code> if you want to learn the essentials of coding</b>.<br/>
                    We think that you should.</p>
