        <!---
        Some of you have not collected data yet - please do so.
        We describe what data are and how you might record them here.
        Then there is the 'when' question.
        Well you collect data whenever you observe something that is interesting and needs recording - hence the need to make data collection easy.
        But also, there is the 'over what periods' question.
        Well we hope that some of you started collecting data weeks ago and continue tio do so.
        But if you have not started, consider weeks 06 and 07 as an interesting data collection window.
        These two weeks are very different - Reading Week, and then a week of regular term.
        Your data recording activity may capture the differences, And then why not continue for week 08 to see whether it it more similar to wek 07 (as might be expected) or week 06?
        
        This is a really good opportunity to start recording what yuo see, and the more you see, and the more you collect, the more richly describe the phenomenon that you are interested in, the more expressive, interesting and useful the visualization you produce will be.

        If you have not yet started - go for it ... start observing and recording!

            A few of you have asked <i>how</i> to collect data and <i>what</i> we actually mean by data as you create your <a href="https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/mod/page/view.php?id=791720">Dear Data</a> inspired <a href="https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/mod/page/view.php?id=795684">Data Diaries</a></i>.
        </p>
        <p>Basically, <i>Data</i> in this context is any recording made of an observation, and you should make these as easily as possible, with sufficient information to capture what has been observed. For example ...</p>
        </div>

        <div class="units-row">

            <p>You can collect numbers, photographs, words, anything you like really that <i>captures the phenomenon that interests you</i>.</p>
            <p>Just do this regularly and with consistency, although what you actually collect may change over time as your data collection informs your process.</p>
            <p>Try to minimise these changes though, as you really want your data to be as consistent over time as possible, but see in one of the examples below, that we decided to collect something additional as we realised that the data that we were capturing was not sufficiently rich</p>
