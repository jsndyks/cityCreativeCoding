                <p><a href="https://hejsweden.com/en/have-coffee-breaks-called-fika-swedish/">Fika</a> is '<i>coffee</i>' backwards in 19th century Swedish!</p>
                <ul><li>kaffi -> ffi-ka -> fika</li></ul>
                <p>But it describes a tradition in which people who are often working together stop to meet, chat, exchange knowledge, opinions and work out where they are at. Usually with a coffee, but other options are available.</p>
                <p>It is also one of my favourite cafés - <a href="https://www.facebook.com/fikacafes/">Fika</a> is a great place to stop when you are in Oakham.
                    Call in next time you are passing through Rutland!</p>
                <p>We are finishing <code>#CreativeCoding</code> with <b>fika</b> Friday as we want to encourage you to take time to stop, reflect and discuss your learning, your progress and your learning needs throughout your degree. We want to set up some good practice here. And we want to reward you for a full and busy two weeks and get you to discuss your experiences, your successes and failures, and ours too, with colleagues, tutors and others in the Department of Computer Science.</p>
                <p>So please come along - we will ask you to sign up in advance so that we can cater for everybody.</p>
                <p>We also want to give you a target - at our <b>fika</b> Friday we would like you to ...</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>show up</b> - have something to eat and drink</li>
                    <li><b>meet your personal tutor</b> - your academic guide for the next few years, somebody you need to get to know</li>
                    <li><b>identify and explain</b> - an interesting piece of <code>code</code> that you could not have written at the start of <code>#CreativeCoding</code> and explain what it does</li>
                    <li><b>show</b> - something that you have produced</li>
                    <li><b>see</b> - what others have done, and chat to them. Find out how they did it, what they learned, and get them to <b>explain</b> - <b>fika</b>!</li>
                </ul>

                <p>You will be asked to sign up beforehand, to prepare an example sketch that contains code that you can explain, and to bring laptops so that you can showcase your work and tell us how <code>#CreativeCoding</code> has been for you.</p>
