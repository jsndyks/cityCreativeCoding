       <p>
            We have had a few conversations with students about the value of our <code>#CreativeCoding</code> activity,
            so we thought it wise to be explicit about why we consider it important that you invest time and effort into it.<br/>
            Read on, and as ever, use the discussion boards to react, ask questions and challenge us.
        </p>
        </div>

        <div class="units-row">

<p>You get no credit and you get no marks for <code>#CreativeCoding</code>. Nothing. Nil. Nada. <br><br>
<b>So what&apos;s the point?</b><br/>Why should you invest time, effort, frustration and imagination, energy and attention into something that doesn&apos;t give you any credit or marks towards your degree?</p>
<p>Here are a few reasons, that help explain why we are putting effort into <code>#CreativeCoding</code> and why we encourage you to do so too. Remember, you decide on your learning journey at University, and we encourage you to take full advantage of all opportunities available. We hope that being explicit about the benefits here will persuade you to participate fully in <code>#CreativeCoding</code>.</p>

<p><code>#CreativeCoding</code> provides you with resources, examples, opportunities, time, and support to develop skills in coding, data use and creative thinking.</p>
<p>If you follow the <b>DATA</b> --> <b>DEPICTION</b> --> <B>DISCOVERY</B> process that we are encouraging then you will be doing some <i>design</i> work to inform some <i>analytical thinking</i> that may result in some reflection and <i>self-awareness</i> too.</p>
<p>As you develop these skills they will help you make progress in your degree and your career.<br>
Investment now will have direct benefits down the line.</p>
<h4 class="mume-header" id="the-knowledge">The Knowledge</h4>

<p><code>#CreativeCoding</code> gives you a chance to engage with <i>key programming concepts</i> and approaches to <i>computational thinking</i> in new ways.</p>
<p>Once again, investment now will have direct benefits in the near future.</p>
<h4 class="mume-header" id="the-portfolio">The Portfolio</h4>

<p>We work with lots of colleagues and former students in business, industry and government, with friends and partners at places you will have heard of like Google, Meta, Microsoft and Apple, and others that you won&apos;t.</p>
<p>The Centre for Doctoral Training that we are setting up with &#xA3;8M of government funding also has &#xA3;1M backing from industrial collaborators - such as: BT; Ordnance Survey; The Natural History Museum; The Nuclear Decommissioning Agency; Genetec; Observable; The British Red Cross; The Greater London Authority.</p>
<p>Increasingly we hear the importance of a portfolio when candidates are considered for technical roles.</p>
<blockquote>"The first thing an employer looks at is the GitHub repo"</blockquote>
<p>Your repo will develop over time, but getting started early, and having commits now, getting into the habit and ensuring regular commits as you move through your degree will give you something very valuable.</p>
<p>Using GitHub as a means of securing, protecting and developing your work is important in terms of the skills you will gain and the resources you will develop. It gives you ownership of your work and evidence of your activity that protects you.</p>
<p>Develop a portfolio of <i>Processing</i> sketches to show the scope of your work and the creativity that you are capable of so that employers get to see your progress, talent and capability.<br>
Develop a graphical component to your portfolio to impress.<br>
Use data that you have collected to stand out and make it personal.</p>
<h4 class="mume-header" id="the-academic">The Academic</h4>

<p>Knowing an academic is useful. They have experience, they have connections, they can advise and make recommendations. This is particularly useful and helpful if they know a bit about you.</p>
<p>The academic you will probably get to know best during your time at University is your Personal Tutor.</p>
<p><code>#CreativeCoding</code> gives you a chance to get to know them on your terms, share with them in ways that reveal something about you. Show them something that interests you, something about you, something you have created ... and use this focus to develop your relationship with them.</p>
<p>This will help you develop some rapport with your tutor as they provide guidance and advice throughout your time at City - when things are good, and perhaps when things are not going quite so well. This is an important opportunity to engage at the start of your academic career.</p>

<figcaption>
    <b>Be Inspired</b><br/>
    To see the World through a new lens <br/>
that stimulates expression and creativity<br/>
and have this seen by your tutor and captured<br/>
in the references they write for you.
</figcaption>
    </figure>
</div>

<p>We spend a fair amount of time providing references to current and former students to help them get started and make progress in their careers. Sometimes this is immediately after graduation, sometimes it is 10 years down the line.</p>
<p><code>#CreativeCoding</code> will give you a personal paragraph that describes your approach to and engagement with the activity. We are looking for initiative, participation, creativity, and group-work capability in <code>#CreativeCoding</code> and the tutorials. We would like to write something that is personal, about you, influenced by you, that reflects your style, approach and contribution - something that presents you as a capable, thoughtful and reliable candidate, as somebody who we know, as somebody who stands out.</p>
<p>References that are <i>personal</i> are important, and the <code>#CreativeCoding</code> activity gives you a chance to stand out and make an impact.</p>
<p>Each tutor will produce a summary of your participation, work and those things that we are looking out for -- <i>initiative, participation, creativity, and group-work capability</i> -- that will be ready for the start of Term 2, so that you can use these recommendations for Y1 internships when you need them, <i>before you have provisional module marks</i>.</p>
<p>This will be something that they can draw upon subsequently when you request references in the future.</p>
<h4 class="mume-header" id="the-pointless">The Pointless</h4>

<p>There is some concern amongst us teachers around the increasing focus on <em>marks as motivation</em>. And yet there is more to life, education and University than mark optimization. The marks are only part of the picture.</p>
<p>It sometimes feels as though schools are training students to play a game that optimises grades with channelled guidance on where to put effort. This will not work well at University, where tasks get more complex and solutions to the questions that we ask become more diverse, less easy to specify, more unknown at the outset.</p>
<p>It does not translate well to the <i>World of Work</i> either. So we want to confront this early on in your course. You will need to do things that have unknown, uncertain vague or long term benefit, and we will advise you on this. You will not only need to do things that have obvious immediate effects on your grades.</p>
<p>Of course, if you think for a minute, there are plenty of obvious examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>friends</strong> - finding like-minded people, spending time with them, learning from them - remember <i>Prof. Golnaz&apos;s</i> advice in induction - spend time finding your friends, even if we don;t give you marks for this;</li>
<li><strong>fun things</strong> - keep your motivation up, your mind fresh, yourself happy by investing in fun stuff - we all need a break and some variety in our lives;</li>
<li><strong>careers</strong> - engage with the University&apos;s <i>Careers &amp; Employability Service</i>.<br>Data shows that those who do so sooner are more likely to be employed at the ends of their degrees.</li>
<li><strong>sleep</strong> - you don&apos;t get points for sleeping, but recovery and rest are essential for effective study (and basic functioning and most other things). You will need to invest time in this.</li>
<li><strong>nutrition</strong> - see above</li>
<li><strong>exercise</strong> - see above</li>
<li><strong>spirituality</strong> - very important for some of us</li>
<li><strong>football</strong> - very important for some of us too</li>
<li><strong>family</strong> - many of us are lucky enough to have caring commitments and dependencies, see &apos;fun things&apos;!</li>
<li><strong>clubs</strong> - engage with the Computer Society for some excellent experience, training and to connect with, learn from and enjoy the company of colleagues in your discipline across years. Try the Robotics Society, they have amazing events. Or find your own thing!</li>
<li><strong>employment</strong> - gives you money, helps you study, gives you experience, doesn&apos;t deliver grades directly</li>
<li><strong>stage 1</strong> - when you come to think of it - the whole the whole of your first year, which you need to pass to progress, does not contribute points to your final degree. While what you learn in year 1 will form a foundation as you go on in your degree to study more sophisticated subjects that build upon this, your marks (that appear on your transcript) make no contribution to your final degree class.</li>
</ul>
<p>Actually, even writing this message doesn&apos;t get us any points.<br>
But we think and hope it&apos;s worthwhile.</p>
<p><i>Pointless</i>, does not equate to <i>Worthless</i>.</p>
<h4 class="mume-header" id="the-experience">The Experience</h4>

<p><code>#CreativeCoding</code> deliberately exposes you to some approaches that help you learning to learn at University.</p>
<p>You are using online resources &amp; reading lists.<br>
You are dealing with tasks that are specified without model answers, tasks that build from a specification that can be interpreted and addressed in multiple ways, rather than tasks that build to a target.</p>
<p>You are learning to be creative, understanding how to stand out and gaining experience of how to select and work on a topic that is of interest to you will set you up well for University education, in particular the project in your final year.</p>
<p>You are using open discussion boards (not much action here yet), engaging and working with colleagues, getting to know the TAs and how to get help.</p>
<p>At the start of term, one academic colleague told us that:</p>
<blockquote>"If [the students] get to year 2 knowing that they have to work, and knowing how to do it then that&apos;s a success"</blockquote>
<p>We have designed <code>#CreativeCoding</code> to help you learn to learn.</p>

<p>Between us, the team that has planned, approved, delivered and put their own time, effort, frustration and imagination into <code>#CreativeCoding</code> has hundreds of years of University teaching experience at a range of institutions.</p>
<p>We have developed these ideas, lectures, examples and resources because in our experience and opinion they give you important learning opportunities and experiences.</p>
<p>If you don&apos;t take part, if you don&apos;t attend, try, embrace the <code>#CreativeCoding</code> culture, then you are rejecting this experience and guidance.</p>
<p>That is your prerogative, you are adults and you define your learning journey, and yet we encourage you to draw upon the knowledge, experience and advice of the academics at University.</p>
<p>These people are at the forefront of their research fields in Computer Science - they see the future.<br><br>
They have vast experience of University education - they know the past.<br>
<br>We strongly encourage you to trust their judgment and engage in all teaching activities. In particular have designed <code>#CreativeCoding</code> to help you :</p>
<ul>
<li>get to know people</li>
<li>introduce key programming concepts</li>
<li>encourage creative thinking</li>
<li>encourage computational thinking</li>
<li>encourage you to get to know yourselves and your peers through data, and to reflect on your relationship with data</li>
<li>develop the Y1 CS community</li>
<li>learn some core technology for productivity &amp; collaboration and practice</li>
<li>build relationships between students and tutors</li>
</ul>
<p>We are striving to enable you achieve these things and to support you in doing so.<br><br>
Please engage.</p>
