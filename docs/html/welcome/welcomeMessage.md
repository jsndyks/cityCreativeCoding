Hello.

This is a quick welcome to BootCamp, and a pointer to a page that contains a slightly fuller welcome that I would like to send your way.

I have been teaching on BootCamp for almost a decade and have made a few notes on some important themes that you should consider as we begin our fortnight of fun.

You can find them here on Moodle :

- [https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/mod/page/view.php?id=460664](https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/mod/page/view.php?id=460664)

There are some thoughts on:

- **Nice Notebooks** - presents
- **Neat NoteTaking** - tips
- **Enthusiastic Explanation** - an introduction
- **Student Suggestions** - more tips
- **Inappropriate Intelligence** - AI
- **Fika Friday** - something to look forward to, I am organising

Do have a look when you get the chance.

And please make sure you know ...

- **_which group_** you will be in for the labs on Monday,
- **_which room_** these take place in, and
- **_where_** the room is actually located.

Everything should be on [MyTimetable](https://mytimetable.city.ac.uk/).

I'm really looking forward to interacting with you at BootCamp.

I will be predominantly online, in the _Zoom Rooms_ to chat about your _Processing_ progress, problems and pong simulators (try something else - be imaginative) ... but hope to see you on Campus and at _The Crypt_ next Friday.
