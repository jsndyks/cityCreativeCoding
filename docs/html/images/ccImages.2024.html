        <h3>1. All Kinds of Images</h3>

        <p>Images allow us to record information, communicate, express ourselves and much more.<br/>
            So let's kick off by having a think about images, Computer Science and <i>Processing</i>, which is what we are using as
            an enabling technology in <code>#CreativeCoding</code>.
        </p>

        <hr>
        <h4>1.1 - How many images in the World?</h4>

        <div class="units-row">

            <div class="unit-70-cc">
                <p>We all use and make images on a daily basis - the World seems to be full of them. But how many are
                    there?</p>

                <p>Lots.<br />
                    The influential <a href="https://www.bondcap.com/report/itr19/#view/77">Meeker Report</a> on
                    <i>Internet Trends</i> suggested that in 2019 well over a billion images were shared every month, and over a
                    trillion photos taken each year.
                </p>
                <p>It's an increasing trend, as shown by the image to the right.</p>

                <p>
                    Many of these are taken with digital cameras.<br/>
                    Quite a few of these involve me and my selfies.<br/>
                    Unsurprisingly, this is also an increasing trend.<br />
                    Below 👇 we have an image from <a href="https://www.statista.com/chartoftheday/">Statista</a> that shows this
                    nicely.<br />
                    And here's another one from <a
                        href="https://www.businessinsider.com/12-trillion-photos-to-be-taken-in-2017-thanks-to-smartphones-chart-2017-8?r=US&IR=T">Business
                        Insider</a> that shows the same data in a slightly different way.<br />You see, we even get multiple
                    images of the same information about images!

                    People are taking and making images all over the place.
                    Indeed digital imaging industry experts <a
                        href="https://focus.mylio.com/tech-today/how-many-photos-will-be-taken-in-2020">Keypoint
                        Intelligence</a> predicted that "<i>humanity will take 1,436,300,000,000 photos in 2020</i>".<br/>
                      They didn't predict the pandemic though. Hmmmm ... did we take and make more or fewer images during the pandemic than during <i>normal</i> times?</p>

                <div class="aside">
                  Have a think - how did you use (take, make, read, seek) images differently during the COVID-19 lockdowns?

        <div class="units-row">

            <div class="unit-70-cc">

                <p>So, how many is that? What would it look like?<br /><br />

                    Well, back in the day, I used to take photos and either (occasionally) develop them on photographic
                    paper or (when things went digital) print them out, usually at 6x4 inches.<br />
                    That's 15.25 x 10.16cm, so 155 cm&sup2 per photo.<br />
                    I'd lay them out on a table to look them through.</p>

                <p>What would it look like if we printed and laid out all the photos taken in the World in a
                    year?<br /><br />

                    We know that at least 1 trillion photos are taken per year.<br/>
                    If we printed them at 6x4 inches, then laying them out so that they did't overlap would cover 155
                    trillion cm&sup2.<br />

                    This is <a
                        href="https://www.thecalculatorsite.com/conversions/area/square-kilometers-to-square-centimeters.php">around
                        15,500 km&sup2</a>.<br />

                    Greater London is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London#cite_note-total-2">about 1,500
                        km&sup2</a> in size.<br />
                    So a years worth of photos would cover London - 10 deep.</p>

                <p>There are various problems with this idea though.<br/>
                    Not least of which, my printer takes about 6 seconds to churn out a photo.<br />
                    Printing all of these pictures would take around 5 trillion seconds.<br />
                    That's about 150,000 years.<br />
                    Of continuous printing.<br />
                    I give up.</p>

                <p>Like I said, lots of photos.</p>

        <h4>1.2 - Images and computing</h4>
        <div class="units-row">
            <div class="unit-70-cc">
                <p>So how do we use images in Computing?<br />
                    Well, there are almost as many ways as there are images.<br />
                    Here are a few examples.</p>

                <dl>

                        Generating images, computer graphics
                        <p>
                            Examples: Cameras, satellites, telescopes, computer games, movies, data visualization, maps,
                            art<br />
                            Remember: you can create images in <i>Processing</i> with the
                            <code><a href="https://processing.org/reference/save_.html">save()</a></code> method - which
                            will generate an image from the content of the canvas whenever you call it.<br />E.g.
                            <code><a href="https://processing.org/reference/save_.html">save("image.jpg")</a></code>.
                        </p>
                        <p><i>During <code>#CreativeCoding</code> you'll be making plenty of images with
                                <i>Processing</i> and may create an image to share with others on the final Friday.</i>

                <p>
                    For our purposes, an image is a two-dimensional array, or regular grid, of colours.
                    One can think of these as grid of miniature coloured rectangles positioned next to one another on
                    the screen.
                    They are much like a mosaic of tiles, each tile being of a single colour.
                </p>
                <p>Mosaics are great - they allow us to create physical images and decorate our floors, bathrooms,
                    window ledges ...</p>

                    followed this idea.

                    To store regular grid mosaics digitally, we record information about the colour in each tile, and where each tile is positioned in the grid.
                    The more tiles, the more detail. 
                </p>

                <p>We don't refer to these individually coloured elements of the image as tiles though.
                    We refer to them as picture elements - or <b><i>pixels</i></b> for short.

                <p>And you will already have some ideas about how we specify colours digitally.</p>

        <h4>2.4 - 16 Million Colours</h4>

        <p>We add colour to our images by recording three numbers, rather than just one, for each pixel.
            These are the amounts of red, green, and blue present at each pixel.
            Combining these three <i>colour components</i>, or <i>channels</i> as they are sometimes called, allows us
            to describe colours very precisely.<br />
            Specifying the red, green and blue components of any colour on a scale of 0-255 allows us to differentiate
            between 256㎥ colours.
            That's more than 16 million different colour combinations.
            This is plenty in most circumstances.

                <!--h3>Colour</h3-->
                <p>In <i>Processing</i>, we can create colours with <code><a
                        href="http://processing.org/reference/color_.html">color()</a></code>, which accepts three arguments -
                    for the amounts of <span style="color:red">red</span>, <span style="color:green">green</span>, and <span style="color:blue">blue</span> that go into a composite colour.
                    You'll recall that you can set the colour that will be used to fill all subsequent shapes -
                    including any <code><a href="https://processing.org/reference/text_.html">text()</a></code> that you
                    produce - with <code><a href="http://processing.org/reference/fill_.html">fill()</a></code>.</p>

                <p>The colour of the lines, including those that enclose shapes is the stroke colour,
                    set with <code><a href="http://processing.org/reference/stroke_.html">stroke()</a></code>.</p>

                <p>We can create colour variables to store colours in <i>Processing</i> with ...</p>
                <pre class="brush: processing; gutter: false; toolbar: false;">

          color darkBlue = color(0, 0, 100);
    </pre>
                <p>Remember that combining the three primary colours in different proportions, each with 256 possible

                    We can also specify the <i>opacity</i> of a colour - this is the extent to which is it <b>not</b> transparent.
                    So far, we have only considered fully <i>opaque</i> pixels, that do not have any transparency.
                    But we may want to create shapes or add images that overlap and have transparent properties.
                    If we use the mosaic metaphor we can think of these tiles as coloured glass, and the <i>opacity</i>
                    is the extent to which the glass does not let light through. Beer bottles tend to be very opaque,
                    beer glasses tend to be much less so.</p>

                <p>In a <i>Processing</i> colour definition we can add a fourth number to specify the <i>opacity</i> of
                    a colour.
                    This also ranges from :</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>0</b> - fully transparent and so entirely invisible, to</li>
                    <li><b>255</b> - completely opaque, the default if we omit the fourth argument to
                        <code><a href="http://processing.org/reference/color_.html">color()</a></code>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Here are some examples:</p>
                <p>
                <pre class="brush: processing; gutter: false; toolbar: false;">
              color darkBlue = color(0, 0, 100, 64);     // A dark blue that is 25% opaque.
              color darkRed  = color(100, 0, 0, 16);     // A dark red that is almost transparent.
              color myOrange = color(255, 128, 32, 255); // A lovely orange that is completely opaque.
              color anOrange = color(255, 128, 32);      // The same orange - alpha is 255 by default.
            </pre>
                </p>
                <p>Let's have a look at how this works.<br />
                    Consider the blue square in the sketch to the right, and move the mouse from left to right to see
                    the effects of using the alpha channel to specify opacity in <i>Processing</i> sketches.</p>

                        rectangle.</p>

        <h4>4.1 - Loading and displaying an image</h4>

        <div class="units-row">
            <div class="unit-70-cc">
                <p>Let's consider a simple example in which we load an image from a file (again) and display it on the
                    canvas. We have done this before 👆, so
                    this should be a useful reminder.</p>

                <p>The <code><a href="http://processing.org/reference/loadImage_.html">loadImage()</a></code> method can
                    load images into a sketch from various formats including GIF, TGA, JPG and PNG format. As we have
                    seen, the input argument is the name of the image file.
                    It's often best to load the image in the <code>setup()</code> method as we usually only need to do
                    so once.</p>

                <p>
                    The <code><a href="http://processing.org/reference/image_.html">image()</a></code> method is what you use to actually
                    draw the image, starting at an upper left pixel of the image (0, 0), at whatever position you give to <code><a href="http://processing.org/reference/image_.html">image()</a></code>. The first argument is a loaded image, the
                    second and third are the coordinates of the canvas at which we want to draw the image.<br />
                    If the image doesn't change in the sketch then we can often put the <code>image()</code> command in
                    <code>setup()</code> too, so that both loading and drawing only happen once.

                    </ol>
                    <p>Can you extend this sketch with a <code>draw()</code> method that will:</p>
                    <ol start="3">

            <div class="unit-70-cc">
                <p>A common application of image processing is to alter the colours across an image.
                    In <i>Processing</i>, one can manipulate the colours of an image using
                    <code><a href="http://processing.org/reference/tint_.html">tint()</a></code>.
                    If <code><a href="http://processing.org/reference/tint_.html">tint()</a></code> receives one argument, only
                    the brightness of the image is affected. Values range from 0 (no brightness) to 255 (full
                    brightness).
                </p>

                <p>So this will do nothing ...</p>

                <p>Of course, you can draw an image more than once on a canvas, and you can load multiple images into a
                    single sketch.</p>
                <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Warhol">Andy Warhol</a> was an American artist and
                    leading figure in the pop art movement of the 20th century. Some of his work involves an image of a
                    popular figure (Marilyn Monroe, for example) and juxtaposing multiple images with different colours.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We have produced an alternative version that focuses on a slightly less globally iconic (for now)
                    figure.<br />
                    Can you use your <i>Processing</i> skills to do the same?
                </p>
                <p>This allows us to emphasize an important point. The <code>PImage</code> that you create is different
                    to the drawing of the <code>PImage</code> that you position on the canvas. You can draw a single
                    <code>PImage</code> multiple times with the <code>image()</code> method, at different locations,
                    with different tints, and different sizes.
                    The information (data) that you are using to draw it, comes from the <code>PImage</code> that you
                    have created, which comes from the file full of pixel colour values that you loaded into it with <code>loadImage()</code>.
                    So really, you are being asked to draw a single image - the <code>PImage</code> that you created -
                    many times here.

        <h4>4.4 Image filtering</h4>
        <div class="units-row">
            <div class="unit-70-cc">
                <p>Much image processing involves using filters.
                    Filters replace the colour values in each pixel of an image with new values, that either depend on
                    the original colour value held in the pixel or those close to them.</p>
                <p>
                    <i>Processing</i> has powerful built-in support for image filtering using the <a
                        href="http://processing.org/reference/filter_.html"><code>filter()</code></a> method.
                </p>
                <p>For example, <code>filter(INVERT)</code> will invert the colours in an image, that is:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>R = 255 – R;
                    </li>
                    <li>G = 255 – G;
                    </li>
                    <li>B = 255 – B;
                    </li>
                </ul>

            These may have been created by loading and drawing an image, or through other means.</p>
        <p>Here's an example taken from the <i>Processing</i> Documentation that you can adapt:</p>
        <div class="units-row">
            <div class="unit-70-cc">
                <pre class="brush: processing; gutter: false; toolbar: false; ">for (int i = 30; i &lt; width-15; i++) {
  for (int j = 20; j &lt; height-25; j++) {
    color c = color(204-j, 153-i, 0);
    set(i, j, c);
  }
}</pre>

                <div class="codeTask">
                    Try it out!<br />
                    Copy the code into <i>Processing</i> - these two loops should give you a coloured canvas.<br />
                    Adapt the code to change the colours on the canvas in different ways.
                </div>

            </div>

            <div class="unit-30-cc annotation">
                <img src="https://jsndyks.github.io/cityCreativeCoding/images/bootCamp.colorGrid.100.png" width="100">
                
                <p>Copy, paste, run and adapt this code.<br />Use the <a
                        href="https://processing.org/reference/set_.html">Processing Reference Documentation</a> to find
                    out more.</p>
            </div>
        </div>


        <p>This example shows how to set and change pixels in the display directly and dynamically.</p>

        <div class="units-row">
            <div class="unit-70-cc">
                <pre class="brush: processing; gutter: false; toolbar: false; ">void setup() {
  size(320, 240);
}

void draw() {
  for (int y = 0; y &lt; height; y=y+1) {
    for (int x = 0; x &lt; width; x=x+1) {
      float r = 255 * (x / (float) width);
      float g = 255 * (y / (float) height);
      float b = 127.5 + 127.5 * sin(millis() / 1000.0);
      set(x, y, color(r, g, b));
    }
  }
}
</pre>
                <div class="codeTask">
                    <p>
                        Try it out!<br />
                        Use the interactive sketch (click the image to run it).<br />
                        Then, copy the code into <i>Processing</i>.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Use a loop to draw some shapes on the plasma!</li>
                        <li>Save an image of the canvas</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <div class="challenge">
                    <p><b>Challenge - Interactive Plasma</b><br />
                        Vary the parameters and see whether you can make the sketch <i>interactive</i> by adding a dependency
                        such that the colour varies as you vary <code>mouseX</code> and / or <code>mouseY</code>.</p>

        <div class="units-row">
            <div class="unit-70-cc">
        <p>As usual, with <i>Processing</i>, we have introduced loads of ideas and concepts and features and examples
            ... and that's not the half of it.<br />
            So it's important for us to <i>emphasize</i>, and for you to <i>remember</i>, that we don't expect all of
            you to take it all in during our very tightly packed <code>#CreativeCoding</code>.<br />
            There are just introductions.
            You need to try some of them, and check the documentation to see how they work.</p>
        <p>And then look back at the <i>Learning Outcomes</i> - the things that you should be able to do by the end of
            this session.<br />They are listed at the top of this page, and here's a checklist.</p>
</div>
</div>
        <div class="task">
            <p>So, you should be able to check each of these boxes having completed the lecture and the tasks.</p>

            <div class="checkOutcomes" style="padding-left:2em">
                <input type="checkbox" id="sa1">
                <label for="sa1">&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand the terms <i>pixel</i> and <i>resolution</i> a can use them to describe
                    image characteristics<br /></label><br />

                <input type="checkbox" id="sa2">
                <label for="sa2">&nbsp;&nbsp;I can load and display images in <i>Processing</i> with
                    <code>loadImage()</code> and <code>image()</code><br /></label><br />

                <input type="checkbox" id="sa3">
                <label for="sa3">&nbsp;&nbsp;I can apply digital effects such as <code>tint()</code> and
                    <code>blur()</code> to images<br /></label><br />

                <input type="checkbox" id="sa4">
                <label for="sa4">&nbsp;&nbsp;I can use <code>get()</code> and <code>set()</code> to retrieve colours
                    from an image and apply these to the canvas<br /></label><br />

                <input type="checkbox" id="sa5">
                <label for="sa5">&nbsp;&nbsp;I have made some interactive and dynamic sketches in <i>Processing</i> that
                    use images - with <code>PImage</code></label><br />

            <p style="padding-top:1em; margin-bottom:0em">If not, then head back and read through the text, try the
                examples and discuss your efforts with your class teachers.</p>
                <p>Anything else, well, that's a bonus.<p>
        </div>

        <div class="units-row">
            <div class="unit-70-cc">
        <p>Hopefully you're nearly there, and if not, then please use the resources to learn and seek help if you have
            questions or need clarifications - from colleagues, and teaching staff.</p>

        <p>If you have completed the work on this page, and ticked all the boxes then try the optional <b><a
                    href="https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/mod/page/view.php?id=420909">Extra Challenges</a></b> where we use
            some of these ideas to look at <i>animated images</i>, <i>games</i> and <i>maps</i>. This could be fun for
            some of you and may give you ideas for your <b><code>#CreativeCoding</code></b>demos.</p>

        <p>There are a trillion images being taken in the world every year, and there are many more things you could do
            with <i>Processing</i>!</p>
        <p>Take you time.<br/>Try things out.<br/>Get things wrong.<br/>
            Debug systematically.<br/>Understand that it will take time.<br/>Discuss.<br/>Think.<br/>
            Ask
            questions.<br/>Try again.</p>
        <p>Talk to your tutors, and remember that they have many years of experience that helps them and from which you
            can benefit.<br />
            This is what you are aiming to achieve, their level of competence. But not in your first week at Uni!
            Learn from them - and also learn to teach them, because they get things wrong and don't know everything and they can also learn from your ideas, mistakes, conception of the ideas that we're engaging with and ways of thinking. <b>So please communicate.</b></p>
        <p>Most importantly, be creative.
            Put ideas together in interesting ways to do new things.<br />
            That's the joy of programming.<br />
            It gives you capabilities that allow you to be creative, to problem solve, to express yourself and to make things.<br />
            You should now be able to use images, structured mosaics of hundreds or thousands or millions or pixels - or
            maybe just 121 - in your <i>Processing</i> sketches.</p>
        <p>Be creative as you add to the one-point-something trillion images that exist and work together to try to make a World that contains <b>two trillion images</b>!</p>

                    <p><code>#CreativeCoding</code> is a busy time for us teachers!
                        There is lots of preparation and we update and check materials, and prepare and practice our lectures every year.</p>
                    <p>It's so busy, that, against my better judgment, I usually end up spending some time on the weekend beforehand tidying things up.</p>
                    <p>There is always some sport on at this time of year - whether it's the <i>Vuelta a Espana</i>, the <i>Rugby World Cup</i>, <i>Leicester City</i> being top of the Premier league (or the Championship) or the <i>Ryder Cup</i>, I do tend to have half an eye on this as I work on the <code>#CreativeCoding</code> lectures.</p>
                    <p>And imagery is always involved.</p>
                    <p>This year - 3D representations of the very latest that's going on in <a href="https://www.rydercup.com/scoring">The Ryder Cup</a> in Rome
                    and up to date pictures of important events direct from <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/live/football/66924211">Lancashire</a>.</p>
                    <p>So, images in lectures and images to distract me as I keep half an eye on the sport!<br/>
                    I am sure you have your thing or things too - let us, and your colleagues know how you use images.</p>
