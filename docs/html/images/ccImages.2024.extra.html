        <h3>Image sequences for animation</h3>
        <div class="units-row">
            <div class="unit-70">
        <p>
            We have seen that we can use multiple images on the canvas, with different processing and effects.
            But sometimes we would like to change the image that we show as time progresses.
            Displaying a series of images in sequence enables us to animate, and this is how we use images to
            produce movies (25 images per second) and games (canvas updates in relation to interaction with the
            screen).</p>
        <p>For example, in a game, a character might have multiple images for different poses as they complete
            some action.</p>

                <p>Incidentally, many browsers will let you drag these eight images 👆 (one by one) straight from the web page into a folder or even a sketch.</p>
                <p>
                    Arrays come in handy storing multiple images that represent a character in sequence. 
                    We can create an array of images, just as we have created arrays of integers, floating point numbers and Strings.
                    Each image can be indexed by its position in the array as shown in the following code snippet.</p>

      PImage [] sprite = new PImage[8];

      // -- Use a loop to load a different image into each array element.
      for (int i = 0; i &lt; 8; i=i+1) {
        sprite[i] = loadImage("man" + i + ".png");
        // -- Use println() for debugging and reporting :
        println("Loaded image\t","man" + i + ".png");
      }

      // -- Draw whichever image is in the element indexed by the variable 'frame'.
      image(sprite[frame], 0, 0);

              <p>This is just a few lines of code that may be helpful.<br/>

        <p>Now try a couple of challenges to take things a little further ...</p>

        <h3>Charlie's Challenge : Forest Run</h3>

        <p><i>Charlie Watson</i> and our former colleague <i>Greg Slabaugh</i> produced the bones of a game and we hope
            that some of you might enjoy developing it a little.</p>
        <hr>
        <p>OK, just so you know, this task is much harder than the rest and we only expect a few of you who are
            experienced programmers to take it on.<br/>But some of you seem keen to develop games, so here is a start!</p>
        <p>It's also quite open ended and open to interpretation, so discuss your ideas with your class tutor and be
            creative.</p>

        <div class="challenge">
            <p><b>Extra Challenge - Charlie's Challenge</b></p>
            <p>Download the Forest Run program.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://jsndyks.github.io/cityBootCamp/sketches/ForestRun.zip">Forest Run sketch and
                        data</a></li>
            </ul>

            <p>Make the game more playable by doing some of the following:</p>

            <ul>
                <li style="padding-bottom:4px">Using an array, add some scary obstacles along the path, rendered using images.
                    <br/>Note: in the
                    directory there is an image called "log.png" that you're welcome to use.
                    The "camera" in the game is moving horizontally with the player.
                    So when drawing objects, simply subtract the <code>playerPosition.x</code> from the location.
                    For example, <code>image(object, location[i].x -playerPosition.x, location[i].y);</code> where
                    <code>location[i]</code> is the location of the ith object.
                </li>
                <li style="padding-bottom:4px">If instead you'd prefer to use your own image instead of "stump.gif", but it lacks a transparent
                    background, you can use image editing software (like <a href="http://www134.lunapic.com/editor/?action=transparent">LUNAPIC</a>) to make the background transparent.
                </li>
                <li style="padding-bottom:4px">Implement a collision detection algorithm to test whether the player has collided with one of the
                    obstacles.<br/>Note: included in the code is a method <code>collisionDetection()</code>, which can be
                    used to see if two rectangular image objects are overlapping.<br/>
                    Since the objects are not exactly rectangular, and there are extra pixels around the objects
                    (particularly the sprite) in the images, some padding may be required to relax the collision
                    detection.
                </li>
                <li style="padding-bottom:4px">Implement an appropriate action when the player collides with an obstacle<br/>(i.e., life lost or game
                    over).
                </li>
                <li style="padding-bottom:4px">Using another array, add some pickups for the game.<br/>
                    The data directory contains an image named "coin.jpg"
                    that you can use for this purpose.
                </li>
                <li style="padding-bottom:4px">Apply collision detection to the pickups.<br/>If the player collides with a pickup, make it disappear (stop drawing it).
                </li>
                <li style="padding-bottom:4px">Implement a scoring system to keep track of the player's score.
                </li>
                <li style="padding-bottom:4px">Implement a heads up display that shows the player's score using the <a href="http://processing.org/reference/text_.html">text()</a> method.
                </li>
                <li>Try other cool things - go for it!</li>
            </ul>

            <p><b>Extra Challenge - City Ride</b></p>
            <p>Jason has produced a rudimentary sketch that allows you to interact with geographically positioned
                photographs that he has taken on his ride to work.
                <br />You can download the sketch and some pictures, and see if you can adapt it:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://jsndyks.github.io/cityBootCamp/sketches/cityRide.zip">cityRide sketch and data</a>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Download, unzip and check the code.
                You'll see that you need to press 'p' to view the photo locations, and click the map symbols that appear
                to see them.</p>
            <p>The map data is from the Ordnance Survey and made available for teaching purposes under the condition
                that is it always used with the following copyright statement:</p>

            </ul>
            <p>Can you ...</p>
            <ol>
                <li>refactor to use a <code>geoPicture</code> class?</li>
                <li>add some photos of your own?<br /><i>Press 't' to see the screen coordinates at any position on the
                        map</i></li>
                <li>make it much better in wildly imaginative ways as part of your <code><b>#BootCamp</b></code> demo?</li>
            </ol>
