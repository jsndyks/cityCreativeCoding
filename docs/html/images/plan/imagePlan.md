There are 5 parts.
Each will take approx 10 mins.
Apols if I go over.
I think we have some flexibility here.

In the groups afterwards, please ask students to simply read through the lecture notes and complete the tasks. From the top!

The 'Exercises' are just a few more complex tasks to generate ideas among those who complete the lecture notes.

WARNING: I have had real problems with my computer shutting down and rebooting with no warning.

If this happens - please somebody load the appropriate video (depends on when the crash happens and share screen). I can usually get back from a crash in 3 minutes.

Plan is to end at approx these times ...
