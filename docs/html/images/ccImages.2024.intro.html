        <h3>1. All Kinds of Images</h3>

        <p>Images allow us to record information, communicate, express ourselves and much more.<br/>
            So let's kick off by having a think about images, Computer Science and <i>Processing</i>, which is what we are using as
            an enabling technology in <code>#CreativeCoding</code>.

            <div class="unit-70-cc">
                <p>We all use and make images on a daily basis - the World seems to be full of them. But how many are
                    there?</p>

                <p>Lots.<br />
                    The influential <a href="https://www.bondcap.com/report/itr19/#view/77">Meeker Report</a> on
                    <i>Internet Trends</i> suggested that in 2019 well over a billion images were shared every month, and over a
                    trillion photos taken each year.
                </p>
                <p>It's an increasing trend, as shown by the image to the right.</p>

                <p>
                    Many of these are taken with digital cameras.<br/>
                    Quite a few of these involve me and my selfies.<br/>
                    Unsurprisingly, this is also an increasing trend.<br />
                    Below ðŸ‘‡ we have an image from <a href="https://www.statista.com/chartoftheday/">Statista</a> that shows this
                    nicely.<br />
                    And here's another one from <a

                        Insider</a> that shows the same data in a slightly different way.<br />You see, we even get multiple
                    images of the same information about images!

                    People are taking and making images all over the place.
                    Indeed digital imaging industry experts <a href="https://riseaboveresearch.com/rar-reports/2022-worldwide-image-capture-forecast-2021-2026/">Rise Above Research</a> predicted that <i>1,720,000,000,000</i> digital photos would be taken in 2024</i> according to <a

            <div class="unit-70-cc">

                <p>So, how many is that? What would it look like?<br /><br />

                    Well, back in the day, I used to take photos and either (occasionally) develop them on photographic
                    paper or (when things went digital) print them out, usually at 6x4 inches.<br />
                    That's 15.25 x 10.16cm, so 155 cm&sup2 per photo.<br />
                    I'd lay them out on a table to look them through.</p>

                <p>What would it look like if we printed and laid out all the photos taken in the World in a
                    year?<br /><br />

                    We know that at least 1.5 trillion photos are taken per year.<br/>
                    If we printed them at 6x4 inches, then laying them out so that they did't overlap would cover 233
                    trillion cm&sup2.<br />

                    This is <a
                        href="https://www.thecalculatorsite.com/conversions/area/square-kilometers-to-square-centimeters.php">around
                        23,250 km&sup2</a>.<br />

                    Greater London is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London#cite_note-total-2">about 1,500
                        km&sup2</a> in size.<br />
                    So a years worth of printed 6x4 inch photos would cover London - 15 deep.</p>

                <p>There are various problems with this idea though.<br/>
                    Not least of which, my printer takes about 6 seconds to churn out a photo.<br />
                    Printing all of these pictures would take around 9 trillion seconds.<br />
                    That's about 285,000 years.<br />
                    Of continuous printing.<br />
                    Which is a lot of ink.<br/>
                    And <a href="https://humanorigins.si.edu/evidence/behavior/stone-tools/middle-stone-age-tools">technology may have changed quite a lot</a> by then.<br/>
                    I give up.</p>

                <p>Like I said, lots of photos.</p>

        <h4>1.2 - Images and computing</h4>
        <div class="units-row">
            <p>So how do we use images in Computing?<br />
                Well, there are almost as many ways as there are images.<br />
                Here are a few examples.</p>

                        <p>Image Creation to Explore Data:<br />
                            We create images to show structure in data in our Computer Science research at the <a
                                href="https://www.gicentre.net/featuredpapers#/woodvisualizing2011/">giCentre</a> - often with
                            <i>Processing</i>.<br />
                            Here is a visualization showing where and when rental bikes are cycled in London.<br/>
                            We learn about Data Visualization later in <code style="font-size:80%"><b>#CreativeCoding</b></code>.

                            You can create images that capture the content of the canvas in <i>Processing</i> with the
                            <a href="https://processing.org/reference/save_.html"><code>save()</code></a> method - which
                            will generate an image from whatever is drawn on the canvas whenever you call it.<br />E.g.
                            <a href="https://processing.org/reference/save_.html"><code>save("image.jpg")</code></a>.
                        </p>
                        <p><i>During <code>#CreativeCoding</code> you'll be making plenty of images with

                    For our purposes, an image is a two-dimensional array, or regular grid, of colours.
                    One can think of these as grid of miniature coloured rectangles positioned next to one another on
                    the screen.
                    They are much like a mosaic of tiles, each tile being of a single colour.
                </p>
                <p>Mosaics are great - they allow us to create physical images and decorate our floors, bathrooms,
                    window ledges ...</p>
                <p>If you look carefully when you visit Paris, you'll see occasional tile mosaics made by <a
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invader_(artist)">Invader</a> and various others who have
                    followed this idea.

                    To store regular grid mosaics digitally, we record information about the colour in each tile, and where each tile is positioned in the grid.
                    The more tiles, the more detail. 
                </p>

                <p>We don't refer to these individually coloured elements of the image as tiles though.
                    We refer to them as picture elements - or <b><i>pixels</i></b> for short.

                </p>
                <p>And you will already have some ideas about how we specify colours digitally.</p>

            <h4>2.1 - Image resolution</h4>
            <p>
                We refer to the number of pixels contained in an image as its <i>resolution</i>.<br />
                The more pixels, the more detail, the higher resolution.</p>
    
            <p>The numbers of pixels in these example images increases from the top left (3x3) to bottom right
                    (300x300).</p>
            <p>You should see that there is more detail in the image as we increase the number of pixels used,
                    thereby increasing the <i>resolution</i> of the image.</p>
            <p>The white gaps between pixels in these examples are just there to help show the grid structure - we
                    would remove them when displaying or printing an image.</p>

        <h4>2.4 - 16 Million Colours</h4>

        <p>We add colour to our images by recording three numbers, rather than just one, for each pixel.
            These are the amounts of red, green, and blue present at each pixel.
            Combining these three <i>colour components</i>, or <i>channels</i> as they are sometimes called, allows us
            to describe colours very precisely.<br />
            Specifying the red, green and blue components of any colour on a scale of 0-255 allows us to differentiate
            between 256ãŽ¥ colours.
            That's more than 16 million different colour combinations.
            This is plenty in most circumstances.
