        <p>We introduce <i>three more tasks</i> that will get you thinking about themes and data that you might collect as we participate in our own <a href="https://www.dear-data.com/theproject">Dear Data Project</a> in <code>#CreativeCoding</code> this term.</p>
        <p>Please complete them, and the three <a href="https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/mod/page/view.php?id=967983">Dear Data Project</a> tasks, <b>before the first <code>#CreativeCoding</code> lecture</b>.</p>

        </div>


        <!--- ROW : Dear Data Diary -->
        <h2>Dear Data 100</h2>
        <p>We want you to collect data in similar fashion to the <a href="https://www.dear-data.com/theproject">Dear Data Project</a> over the term.</p>
        <p>We will show you how to use <i>Processing</i> to create a <b><i>Dear Data 100</i></b> demo that explores some aspect of the World that is interesting to you, using your code to engage with your data (and vice versa) and using code to express your data in ways that are meaningful to you.</p>
        <p>With luck, you will learn about yourself and some aspects of the world as you embark upon some discovery by depicting your data in creative ways.</p>

        <p>The task, to be completed by the end of term, with our support, is open ended, and broadly specified - all we ask is that  ...</p>
        <!-- <div style="background-color:#f8f8f8; padding:2rem"> -->

            <div class="coreTask">

        <blockquote>
            Create a <i>Processing</i> sketch<br/>
            that depicts a data set that you have collected over time<br/>
            that explores some aspect of the World<br/>
            that is interesting to you<br/>
            through at least 100 observations

        <p>Hopefully ...</p>
        <blockquote>
            in creative &amp; expressive ways <br/>
            that you are pleased with and<br/>

        </blockquote>
        </div>

        <p>Here's some preparation that will get you started - three more tasks:</p>

    
        <h3>Choose Some Topics</h3>
        <div class="units-row">
            <!--- Column LEFT --->
            <div class="unit-70-cc">
                <p>So, where to start?<br/>
                You will need to do a little <i>reading</i> and some <i>thinking</i>.<br/>
                But that's great because universities are fantastic places to read and think.<br/>
                It's pretty much what they are set up for! (plus some listening).</p>

                <p>The <i>Topic</i> and <i>Data</i> that you collect must be:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>ORIGINAL</b> - the topic should be original - use the creativity techniques that we have touched upon, like <a href="https://rl.talis.com/3/city/items/33961998-4f2b-46a4-b164-08904a3190c6.html">SCAMPER</a> to make it as uniquer as you can;</li>
                    <li><b>MEANINGFUL</b> - the topic must be something that interests and is perhaps important to you;</li>
                    <li><b>ANONYMOUS</b> - the data must not reveal identifying personal information;</li>
                    <li><b>NUMEROUS</b> - you must collect a minimum of 100 observations to show in your demo;</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>So have a think.<br/>What could you do?<br/>What are you interested in?<br/>What could you collect?<br/>What might work for you?</p>

                    <p>Here you can see some guidance on how to start a <a href="https://www.dear-data.com/theproject">Dear Data</a> project from Giorgia &amp; Stefanie. ðŸ‘‰</p>
    
                    <hr class="hrInvisible"/>

                    <div class="coreTask"><h5>Task 4 : Dear Data 100 (preliminary thinking)</h5>
                        <p>Have a look at the guidance provided at the bottom of the <a href="https://rl.talis.com/3/city/items/4D70D3A6-B53C-16B4-5475-A0EB63CDEE4C.html">Dear Data And FiveThirtyEight Want You To Visualize Your Podcast Habits</a> page.</p>

                        <p>Begin to think about the data that you might want to collect - and see whether this is feasible.
                            <br/>Practice, try a few things out ...</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>is this interesting?</li>
                            <li>is it feasible?</li>
                            <li>does it work?</li>
                            <li>might it be ORIGINAL - MEANINGFUL - ANONYMOUS - NUMEROUS?</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Then ask yourself the questions that Giorgia &amp; Stephanie ask:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><i>What do you want to know and explore?</i> - What is your main question?</li>
                            <li><i>What detail and context do you need to record?</i> - What are the additional questions?</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Try to find two or three topics and think about which questions you could ask and what you could record. And how.<br/>Discuss them with others - do they seem feasible? Interesting? Motivating?<br/>
                        Are they ORIGINAL - MEANINGFUL - ANONYMOUS and do they have the potential to be NUMEROUS?</p>
                    </div>
            </div>

                <p>This may sound a little overwhelming!</p>
                <p>But these are early days as we form ideas. We have plenty of time.<br/>
                    For now, stay calm and check some of the documentation that helps us get a handle on the task in hand.</p>
                    <p>Giorgia and Stefanie have written a section in the book entitled <a href="https://rl.talis.com/3/city/items/4551ab37-962c-400e-aba3-5053d168fd75.html">Dear Data - To DRAW is to REMEMBER</a> that helps frame the task and guides us through it.<br/>
                    You should read it.</p>

                <div class="coreTask"><h5>Task 5 : It's Not That Hard</h5>
                    <p>Read the four annotated pages that Giorgia and Stefanie have produced to encourage people like us to embark upon a <i>Dear Data</i> journey:

                    <p>This short document will help you with your thinking about your nascent <i>Dear Data 100</i> demo.</p>
                    <p><b>Please read it.</b> Make notes. Use it to think about your own topic and data collection.</p>
                    <p>Can you come up with any ideas for themes, for data to collect ... and can you begin collecting data in a data diary?</p>

        <p>You should now have some ideas about the topics that interest you and kinds of data that you might start trying to collect in your Dear Data 100 project.<br/>
        It's all about just trying things out, seeing what works, letting things develop and being creative!<br/>
        See you in class in Week 01!<br/>
        Please complete these tasks and try collecting some data before then.</p>

        <div class="coreTask"><h5>Task 6 : Collect Some Data</h5>
            <p>Try collecting some data on your topics of interest for the rest of the week.<br/>
            Come to the <code>#CreativeCoding</code> class in Week 01 with a few observations.<br/>
            Not 100. Not just yet. But come with a sense of:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>possible topics that interest you;</li>
                <li>what you might capture to record and observation;</li>
                <li>how you record your data</li>
