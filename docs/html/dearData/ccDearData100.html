        <p>We introduce <i>three more tasks</i> that will get you thinking about themes and data that you might collect as we participate in our own <a href="https://www.dear-data.com/theproject">Dear Data Project</a> in <code>#CreativeCoding</code> this term.</p>
        <p>Please complete them, and the three <a href="https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/mod/page/view.php?id=967983">Dear Data Project</a> tasks, <b>before the first <code>#CreativeCoding</code> lecture</b>.</p>

        </div>


        <!--- ROW : Dear Data Diary -->
        <h2>Dear Data 100</h2>
        <p>We want you to collect and visualize data over the term in similar fashion to the <a href="https://www.dear-data.com/theproject">Dear Data Project</a>.</p>
        <p>We will show you how to use <i>Processing</i> to create a <b><i>Dear Data 100</i></b> demo that explores some aspect of the World that is interesting to you, using code to engage with your data (and vice versa) and some creative thinking to express your data in ways that are meaningful to you.</p>
        <p>With luck, you will learn about yourself and some aspects of the world as you embark upon some discovery by depicting your data in interesting and innovative ways.</p>

        <p>The task, to be completed by the end of term, with our support, is open ended, and broadly specified - all we ask is that  ...</p>
        <!-- <div style="background-color:#f8f8f8; padding:2rem"> -->

            <div class="coreTask">
        <p>Over this term, as part of the <code>#CreativeCoding</code> activity you ...</p>
        <blockquote>
            Create a <i>Processing</i> sketch<br/>
            that depicts a data set that you have collected over time<br/>
            that explores some aspect of the World<br/>
            that is interesting to you<br/>
            through at least 100 observations
        </blockquote>
        <p>Hopefully ...</p>
        <blockquote>
            in creative &amp; expressive ways <br/>
            that you are pleased with and<br/>
            that helps you learn (a little) about yourself &amp; The World around you
        </blockquote>
        </div>

        <p>Here's some preparation that will get you started - three more tasks:</p>

    
        <h3>Choose Some Topics</h3>
        <div class="units-row">
            <!--- Column LEFT --->
            <div class="unit-70-cc">
                <p>So, where to start?<br/>
                You will need to do a little <i>reading</i> and some <i>thinking</i>.<br/>
                But that's great because universities are fantastic places to read and think.<br/>
                It's pretty much what they are set up for! (plus some listening).</p>

                <p>The <i>Topic</i> and <i>Data</i> that you collect must be:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>ORIGINAL</b> - the topic should be original - use the creativity techniques that we have touched upon, like <a href="https://rl.talis.com/3/city/items/33961998-4f2b-46a4-b164-08904a3190c6.html">SCAMPER</a> to make it as uniquer as you can;</li>
                    <li><b>MEANINGFUL</b> - the topic must be something that interests and is perhaps important to you;</li>
                    <li><b>ANONYMOUS</b> - the data must not reveal identifying personal information;</li>
                    <li><b>NUMEROUS</b> - you must collect a minimum of 100 observations to show in your demo;</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>So have a think.<br/>What could you do?<br/>What are you interested in?<br/>What could you collect?<br/>What might work for you?</p>

                    <p>Here you can see some guidance on how to start a <a href="https://www.dear-data.com/theproject">Dear Data</a> project from Giorgia &amp; Stefanie. ðŸ‘‰</p>
    
                    <hr class="hrInvisible"/>

                    <div class="coreTask"><h5>Task 4 : Dear Data 100 (preliminary thinking)</h5>
                        <p>Have a look at the guidance provided at the bottom of the <a href="https://rl.talis.com/3/city/items/4D70D3A6-B53C-16B4-5475-A0EB63CDEE4C.html">Dear Data And FiveThirtyEight Want You To Visualize Your Podcast Habits</a> page.</p>

                        <p>Begin to think about the data that you might want to collect - and see whether this is feasible.
                            <br/>Practice, try a few things out ...</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>is this interesting?</li>
                            <li>is it feasible?</li>
                            <li>does it work?</li>
                            <li>might it be ORIGINAL - MEANINGFUL - ANONYMOUS - NUMEROUS?</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Then ask yourself the questions that Giorgia &amp; Stephanie ask:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><i>What do you want to know and explore?</i> - What is your main question?</li>
                            <li><i>What detail and context do you need to record?</i> - What are the additional questions?</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Try to find two or three topics and think about which questions you could ask and what you could record. And how.<br/>Discuss them with others - do they seem feasible? Interesting? Motivating?<br/>
                        Are they ORIGINAL - MEANINGFUL - ANONYMOUS and do they have the potential to be NUMEROUS?</p>

                <p>But these are early days as we form ideas. We have plenty of time.<br/>
                    For now, stay calm and check some of the documentation that helps us get a handle on the task in hand.</p>
                    <p>Giorgia and Stefanie have written a section in the book entitled <a href="https://rl.talis.com/3/city/items/4551ab37-962c-400e-aba3-5053d168fd75.html">Dear Data - To DRAW is to REMEMBER</a> that helps frame the task and guides us through it.<br/>

                See you in class in Week 01!<br/>

                    Not 100. Not just yet. But come with a sense of:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>possible topics that interest you;</li>

                <p>We recommend that you use a <i>private</i> repository for all of your <code>#CreativeCoding</code> and move the sketches that you would like to share with the world into a <i>public</i> portfolio that shows off your capability and creativity.</p>

        <!--- ROW : Choose a Partner? -->
        <h3>Dear Data Duo?</h3>
        <div class="units-row">
            <!--- Column LEFT --->
            <div class="unit-70-cc">
                <p>A voluntary idea to help with a voluntary activity: <b>choose a partner</b>?</p>
                <p>When you get to the practical classes in the computer laboratories, share your ideas and data collection experiences with another student in your group. See whether you can agree on a topic (or perhaps two topics) to be the focus of your <i>Dear Data 100</i> project.</p>
                <p>If you do this, be sure to operate under the following understanding - these 5 points should form the basis of a partnership :</p>
                <ol type="i">
                    <li>Each of you must collect data independently;</li>
                    <li>You can choose a common theme (with different criteria for data collection - like <a href="https://www.dear-data.com/theproject">Dear Data</a>), different themes, or two themes so that you both collect two data sets;<br/>
                    ... but you should agree on this at the outset!</li>
                    <li>You must each produce individual code, in individual private repositories.<br/>
                        Advise each other, comment on each other's work, but do not share code or design ideas - the code and demos that you produce should look very different;</li>
                    <li>Be kind and supportive to one another - communicate regularly, give constructive and encouraging feedback;</li>
                    <li>You can end the partnership at any time with no bad feelings - make sure that your progress is inspired by, but not dependent upon your <i>Dear Data partner</i>, and if you want to go independent - be sure to communicate this clearly and with kindness!</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Remember that Giorgia &amp; Stefanie were motivated by, and became friends over the <a href="https://www.dear-data.com/theproject">Dear Data</a> project which they embarked up as a kind of pact between the pair of them.<br/>You may find that bouncing you idea off a colleague and working as Dear Data partners works well.<br/>
                We ask you not to work on a <i>Dear Data 100</i> project in groups of more than two.</p>
