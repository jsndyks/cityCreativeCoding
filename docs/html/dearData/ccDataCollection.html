        Some of you have not collected any data yet - please do so, you will get much more from the Creative Coding activity if you engage.
        To give you a hand, and in response to a couple of questions we describe what data are and give you some ideas about how you might record them here:

        https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/mod/page/view.php?id=818121

        As well as 'what?', there is the 'when' question.

        Well you collect data whenever you observe something that is interesting and needs recording - hence the need to make data collection easy.
        But also, there is the 'over what periods' question.

        Well we hope that some of you started collecting data weeks ago and continue to do so.
        But if you have not started, consider weeks 06 and 07 as an interesting data collection window.
        These two weeks are very different - Reading Week, and then a week of regular term.
        Your data recording activity may capture the differences, And then why not continue for week 08 to see whether it it more similar to wek 07 (as might be expected) or week 06?
        
        This is a really good opportunity to start recording what yuo see, and the more you see, and the more you collect, the more richly describe the phenomenon that you are interested in, the more expressive, interesting and useful the visualization you produce will be.

        If you have not yet started - go for it ... start observing and recording!

        Hopefully this new page helps.

        Jason.

       <p>
            So ... <i>how</i> might you collect data and <i>what</i> we actually mean by data as you create your <a href="https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/mod/page/view.php?id=791720">Dear Data</a> inspired <a href="https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/mod/page/view.php?id=795684">Dear Data 100</a> demos</i>.
        </p>
        <p>Basically, <i>Data</i> in this context is <i>any recording made of any observation</i>.<br/>
            You should make these as easily as possible, with sufficient information to capture what has been observed.
            Some examples and some guidance follow.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Data Collection</h2>


        <div class="units-row">
            <h3>What is Data?</h3>

            <p>You can collect numbers, photographs, words, anything you like really that <i>captures useful characteristics of the phenomenon that interests you</i>.</p>
            <p>Just do this regularly and with consistency, although what you actually collect about the phenomena may change over time as your data collection informs your process.</p>
            <p>Try to minimise these changes though, as you really want your data to be as consistent over time as possible, but see in one of the examples below, that we decided to collect something additional as we realised that the data that we were capturing was not sufficiently rich: were the football shirts current or vintage? After seeing a few we understood that we needed to know (or at least estimate) their age as well as the other characteristics.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="units-row">
            <h4 class="mume-header">Paper</h4>

            <div class="cc-right">
                <figure>
                    <script>loadImage('https://jsndyks.github.io/cityCreativeCoding/html/dearData/img/ccData.paper.jpg', 400, 225, 'Data Collection on Paper');</script>
                    <figcaption>
                        <b>You can collect data on paper</b><br/>
                        Here we might be recording the colour of the traffic lights we pass when on the road, or when walking around town.
                    </figcaption>
                </figure>
            </div>
            <p>Here, we are using a pen and paper to collect data - easy to carry around, quick to record.</p>
            <p>Each row is a day, and every time I observe something that relates to the phenomenon that I am interested in, I jot it down.</p>
            <p>This could be the colour of the traffic lights I pass: <i>Red</i>, <i>Amber</i> or <i>Green</i>.</p>
            <p>It could be the emotions of the public servants I encounter (bus drivers, shop assistants, lecturers): <i>Kind</i>, <i>Rude</i>, <i>Generous</i>, <i>Absent</i>, <i>Whatever</i> or <i>Angry</i>.</p>
            <p>But we don't collect much data during each observation, just a single code.<br/>Can you think of additional characteristics of each observation that you might want to record to give yourself a richer data set?</p>
            <p>There is a trade-off here that you may need to consider. If you are observing something that happens regularly you may not have the time to capture detail ... like the traffic lights example above (although you might be able to record where and when it happened, what you were traveling in and perhaps how long a <i>Red</i> hold lasted?). However if you have fewer observations you may wish to record more characteristics and detail to give yourselves a rich enough data set to produce interesting and rich <b>DESCRIPTIONS</b> that can result in meaningful <b>DISCOVERY</b>.</p>
            <p>This is a balance - check the <a href="https://rl.talis.com/3/city/items/5e26c6e4-9c49-4ee8-8115-6cc431ba2f8a.html">By Week â€” Dear Data</a> page and consider the <i>three examples</i> that you chose to study in detail, and perhaps others that complement these and see whether you can see differences in this trade-off between number of observations and detail of data recording.</p>

            </div>
            <p>We gave you the lovely NoteBooks for a reason - to record data, sketch ideas and help you with your <code>#CreativeCoding</code>.</p>
            <p>When we have more than one characteristic of an observation to record, we often use a table.</p>
            <p>Tables can be effective for recording data if we use one <i>row</i> for each observation, along with <i>columns</i> for each characteristic of the observation.</p>
            <p>We usually want to try to record the same characteristics (<i>columns</i>) each time, but sometimes during our data collection we realise that we need more information about each observation. For example, here it became apparent that the age of the shirt - the season or decade when it was worn by the team, needed to be collected as well as the date, time, football team, whether it was the home or away jersey, and the apparent gender of the wearer.</p>
            <p>We will need to transcribe these data into a digital format at some stage, but that's not a big job and data collection is often quickest, easiest and most reliable when completed using paper and pen.</p>

            <p>This is pretty much the same thing, but digital.</p>
            <p>Most operating systems have handy apps for quick data collection.</p>
            <p>Notice that I am using <i>codes</i> here to record characteristics of each tutorial - how awake did each student <i>seem</i>? I try to be consistent about my judgments here, but my consistency will, to an extent depend upon how awake I am!</p>

            <p>You should be getting the hang of this by now ... rows for observations, columns for characteristics.</p>
            <p>Here we are collecting data about the awkward moments when lecturers say "<i>Ummm...</i>" in lectures.
                Us lecturers try not to do this but its ... Ummm .... like .... Ummm, kinda .... really hard.</p>
            <p>Each "<i>Ummm...</i>" is an event that we want to capture information about, to learn more about when and how the dreaded "<i>Ummm...</i>" occurs. <br/>
            They are particularly awful and painful if they occur right after a failed attempt at a joke by the way.</p>
            <p>So, in this example we are collecting ...</p>
            <ul>
                <li><i>codes</i> - the initials of the lecturer, an <i>String</i> that uniquely and intuitively identifies them</li>
                <li><i>dates</i> - the day on which the "<i>Ummm...</i>" event occurred</li>
                <li><i>times</i> - the time at which the "<i>Ummm...</i>" was uttered</li>
                <li><i>words</i> - or perhaps we could call them <i>Strings</i> - the term, word or phrase that immediately followed the "<i>Ummm...</i>"</li>
                <li><i>codes</i> - a <i>numeric</i> code that tells us something subjective about how flustered and embarrassed the lecturer was when they said "<i>Ummm...</i>"</li>
            </ul>
            <p>But of course, you decide what you record about each event, What is useful? What is interesting? What might help you with data discovery?</p>

                        If you are observing or collecting physical objects, you may want to photograph them before transcribing the numbers. 
                    </figcaption>
                </figure>
            </div>
            <p>Your data collection might involve <i>Photos</i> or even <i>Sounds</i> - what did you see or here about a particular theme?</p>
            <p><i>Processing</i> has powerful capabilities for displaying and manipulating images, video and sound as we will discover.</p>
            <p>Here, I have used a photo to capture some data about ... well ... the appalling garbage 'food' that my daughters managed to collect when dressed as kind of goth Olivia Rodrigo inspired witches out on the streets of our village last Halloween. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="units-row">
            <div class="cc-right" style="padding-left:6rem; padding-right:4rem">

                    <tr><td colspan="4"><i>etc ...</i></td></tr>
                </table>
            </div>

            <p>Of course this will need to be transcribed into a spreadsheet or other digital document at some stage, perhaps as shown to the right, where the quantities come directly from the photo, but the ownership data is recorded (or at least known) elsewhere.</p>


            <p>Or, the photo or audio could be your data itself ... you could record whatever is going on at 9:30 every day for a minute, or the sound in a particular place at different times of day, or the sky at 8am or the first bus that you take each morning. Be imaginative!</p>
            <p>But also remember to be anonymous - note that I have used initials for my daughter's names above (so that nobody can identify <i>April</i> and <i>November</i> by name - D'OH!) , and for the lecturers too.<br/>
            Joking aside ... <i>Ummm ...</i> be sure to record data in ways that do not reveal identity.</p>
