        <h3>Submission Questions ...</h3>

        <div class="qAndA">
        <div class="qAndA-Q">
          &raquo;&nbsp;What do we have to submit exactly for the Dear Data 100 assignment?
        </div>
        <div class="qAndA-A">
          Check the <a href="https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/mod/assign/view.php?id=967987">Dear Data 100 Demo (Assignment Details & Submission)</a> link and click <b class="moodleButton">Add submission</b> for details.<br/>
          I have copied these instructions at the bottom of this page too.
        </div>          
        </div>

        <div class="qAndA">
        <div class="qAndA-Q">
          &raquo;&nbsp;Do we have to submit our observations alongside our processing dear data program?
        </div>
        <div class="qAndA-A">
          <b>Yes</b>.<br/>
          We will need the data file to be able to run the sketch that loads the data - likely with <code>loadStrings()</code>.<br/>
          Any data that you use will probably need to be in the 'data' folder of your sketch, and that will need to be included in the ZIP file that you submit, along with all of the PDEs.

          &raquo;&nbsp;Does it have to be submitted on GitHub?
        </div>

          <b>Yes</b>.<br/>

          We want you to create a <a href="https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/course/section.php?id=243433">Chronicled Compendium of Collaborative Code</a> during your time at Uni and we'd like you to start now.<br/>
          See <i>Alexis'</i> <a href="https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/mod/page/view.php?id=967988">Practical Guide</a> to get going.

<h3>Data Questions ...</h3>

        <div class="qAndA">
        <div class="qAndA-Q">
          &raquo;&nbsp;Do the data have to be numbers?
        </div>
        <div class="qAndA-A">
          <b>No</b>. 👇
        </div>          
        </div>

        <div class="qAndA">
        <div class="qAndA-Q">
          &raquo;&nbsp;Can the data used be a mixture of integers and words?
        </div>
        <div class="qAndA-A">
          <p>
          <b>Yes</b>!<br/>
          Of course, many observations include both.<br/>
          Here's a table that includes observations about <i>gratitude experienced</i>.<br/> It uses <i>integers</i>, <i>decimals</i>, <i>negatives</i>, <i>booleans</i> and <i>strings</i> to capture any "thank you"s that have been received ... with one of the strings being the name of an <i>image</i> (photo) that has been taken.</p>
      <table style="border:1px #e0e0e0 solid; font-size:80%; background-color:#f0f0f0">
      <thead>
      <tr><th>Day</th><th>Hour</th><th>Minute</th><th>Term</th><th>Someone I Knew?</th><th>Sincerity</th><th>Photo</th></tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>

        <div class="qAndA">
        <div class="qAndA-Q">
          &raquo;&nbsp;Can I use more than 100 data items in my Dear Data 100 demo?
        </div>
        <div class="qAndA-A">
          <b>Yes</b>!<br/>
          We say ... <a href="https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/mod/page/view.php?id=967984">through at least 100 observations</a>.
        </div>          
        </div>

                <div class="qAndA">
        <div class="qAndA-Q">
          &raquo;&nbsp;For the Dear Data 100 assignment, does our total number of observations need to be within the set of natural numbers?
        </div>
        <div class="qAndA-A">
          Well it can't be <i>zero</i> as that's not <i>at least 100</i>, and <i>negative observations</i> seem unlikely.<br/>
          So if you are asking whether you can record <i>half</i> and observation or some non-integer number ... I just don't know!<br/>
          You tell me!<br/>Post on the <a href="https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/mod/forum/view.php?id=967978">discussion forum</a> if you need to know more!

        <h3>Topic Questions ...</h3>
        <div class="qAndA">
        <div class="qAndA-Q">
          &raquo;&nbsp;Can my project be about a game I play?
        </div>
        <div class="qAndA-A">
          <b>Yes</b>.

        <div class="qAndA">
        <div class="qAndA-Q">
          &raquo;&nbsp;Can it be about a game called Among us?

        <div class="qAndA-A">
          It can. 👍<br/>
          Or <i>Guitar Hero</i> - see below.

          &raquo;&nbsp;If struggling to find ideas for what visualise are we able to use external datasets such as those found on kaggle with credit to the original data collector given

        <div class="qAndA-A">
          <b>No</b>.<br/>This is about you and your engagement with the World through data that you collect. It's not about the 'product', it's about the <i>process</i>. We want you to actually record some data and you will have seen plenty of ideas about the kind of data you might collect.<br/>
          Do read <a href="https://rl.talis.com/3/city/items/aa74e53c-a111-4937-bf99-2d920b881df6.html">Dear Data - Introduction</a>, which you may find persuasive.

<h3>Show Me A Solution Questions ...</h3>

        <div class="qAndA">
        <div class="qAndA-Q">
          &raquo;&nbsp;I am confused on how to do my project, it would be helpful to have some sort of example of how the project it to be layed out
        </div>
        <div class="qAndA-A">
          <p>
          It would be helpful, and we find that students are excellent at reproducing examples that we give them.<br/>
          But this is not what employers want and it's not what students find that they need when they have left Uni.
          </p> 
          <p>
            So <code>#CreativeCoding</code> takes a different approach.<br/>
            We find that model solutions are <i>constraining</i> and we want to jolt you out of this <i>culture of copy</i>.<br/>
            <i>Thinking is hard!</i> But degrees are hard sometimes and we want to give you the time, space, techniques and opportunity to practice original thinking.<br/> 
            <code>#CreativeCoding</code> gives you the chance to design a solution to a problem that is specified <i>without</i> a model answer.<br/>
            Many real-life design challenges are like this.<br/>
            Designing <code>#CreativeCoding</code> was like this - we didn't have a model module to base this activity oin, just some ideas about what we wanted to achieve and how we might achieve it. We had to be creative in our thinking to come up with a viable (hopefully) solution. And this is it!<br/>
            We will ask for feedback to help improve our design before too long!
          </p>
          <p>
            We explain this, and the <i>Design Process</i> that we would like you to take in the <a href=""https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/mod/page/view.php?id=968104">Creativity : Core</a> notes - see <i>Section 3. Creative (Dear Data 100) Design Process ...</i>.<br/>
            And also have a look at the short and helpful <a href="https://rl.talis.com/3/city/items/4551ab37-962c-400e-aba3-5053d168fd75.html">Dear Data - To DRAW is to REMEMBER</a> annotated pages that explain why "<i>It's not that hard</i>" to do a Dear Data diary. 
          </p>
          <p>And ... when you think about it ... the whole body of <code>#CreativeCoding</code> materials is packed full of examples!<br/>
            Be creative with them.</p>
        </div>          
        </div>

<h3>Persuade Me To Do It Questions ...</h3>

        <div class="qAndA">
        <div class="qAndA-Q">
          &raquo;&nbsp;What is the level of work expected of us to submit?
        </div>
        <div class="qAndA-A">
          <b>Hmmmm ...</b><br/>
          Well, you set the level. Don't worry about anybody else - why do they matter?<br/>
          Try to do something that you are pleased with.<br/>
          Show us something that you can do now that you were not able to do in September. We want to see evidence of learning and creativity.<br/>
          The only way to fail <code>#CreativeCoding</code> is to disengage and not submit anything - this would be a great shame.<br/>
          We are trying to make this as stress-free and fun as possible - you have nothing to lose and lots to learn!<br/>
          Don't let any worrying about <i>levels</i> stop you from participating.
        </div>          
        </div>

        <div class="qAndA">
        <div class="qAndA-Q">
          &raquo;&nbsp;How interactive / creative does the data need to be presented?
        </div>
        <div class="qAndA-A">
          How do we answer this one?!<br/>
          As creative and expressive as you want it to be!<br/>
          Try using <i>SCAMPER</i> and a few design experiments to play with the way the data are depicted.<br/>
          Do your best, try to produce something that makes you happy, do something that you were unable to do in September.
        </div>          
        </div>

        <div class="qAndA">
        <div class="qAndA-Q">
          &raquo;&nbsp;What if we can't find a way to get to 100 individual data pieces?
        </div>
        <div class="qAndA-A">
          <p>
          <b>Hmmmm ...</b><br/>
          OK - I'm going to offer some <i>tough love</i> here - we need to give this sometimes! ❤️</p>
          <p>
          I don't think you are being sufficiently creative in your data collection thinking!<br/>
          We all observe hundreds, thousands, millions of events every day ... it's just a matter of :</p>
          <ul>
            <li>noticing;</li>
            <li>deciding <i>which</i> to record;</li>
            <li>deciding <i>what</i> to record about them</li>
          </ul>
          <p>So go for it!</p>
          <p>
            In class I noticed the interesting wooden floors in <i>The Great Hall</i> and suggested recording the different surfaces that I put my feet on throughout the day. I could record the time (day number, hour, minute), the colour, the soft/hardness of the surface and take a photo. 
          </p>
            <figure>
                <table style="width: 100%; margin: 0 auto; border-collapse: collapse; text-align: center;">
                    <tr>  
                        <td style="width: 30%; height: 100px;">
                            <img src="./img/greatHallFloor.IMG_1430.jpeg" alt="top" style="width: 100%; height: auto;"></td>
                        <td style="width: 30%; height: 100px;">
                            <img src="./img/greatHallFloor.IMG_1431.jpeg" alt="top" style="width: 100%; height: auto;"></td>
                        <td style="width: 30%; height: 100px;">
                            <img src="./img/greatHallFloor.IMG_1432.jpeg" alt="top" style="width: 100%; height: auto;"></td>
                    </tr>
                </table>
                <figcaption>
                    The Great Hall has an overwhelming collection of flooring types to suit the taste of those interested in the materials on which they place their feet. Enjoy.
                </figcaption>
            </figure>

            <!-- Guitar Hero -->
            <div class="figRight">

              </figcaption>
            </figure>
            </div>

          <p>
            I also suggested recording the sequence of buttons that I pressed during a game of <i>Guitar Hero</i>.
          </p>
          <p>
            You could record colour (text) and whether they were right or wrong (boolean). You could get a friend to record for you in real time, or video yourself and play back in slow motion later. You could add the video to the sketch with the <i>Processing</i> video capability, like the <code>Movie</code> class. See <a href="https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/mod/page/view.php?id=968095">Sound and Video : Core</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            My favourite guitar controller has seen me totally kill '<i>One</i>' a few times when I have a <i>Guitar Hero Metallica</i> session (on easy mode). 
          </p>
          <p>But don't do these things - do something that is inspired by them and Dear Data.<br/>Use <a href="https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/mod/page/view.php?id=968104""><i>SCAMPER</i></a> to <i>Substitute</i>, <i>Combine</i>, <i>Adapt</i>, <i>Modify</i> ...</p>
          <ul>
            <li>A different game;</li>
            <li>The floor surface you are on when somebody expressed gratitude;</li>
            <li>Multiple efforts at the same game, multiple people playing the same track / game;</li>
            <li>The floor surface you are on at 12:00;</li>
            <li>Etc.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            And do try the short and helpful <a href="https://rl.talis.com/3/city/items/4551ab37-962c-400e-aba3-5053d168fd75.html">Dear Data - To DRAW is to REMEMBER</a> annotated pages that explain why "<i>It's not that hard</i>" to start a Dear Data diary.

          In general, be as open and helpful as you can in enabling the person who is reading / using your work to find and check the influences.<br/>
          Anything less than this is seen as poor practice at best.<br/>
          This is good advice for the entire degree, and professional practice beyond!

          <b>Relax!</b><br/>
          This is part of the fun.<br/>
          Life sometimes takes you to places that you didn't intend ending up.<br/>
          Just experiment until you find something that you think is OK.<br/>
          If it runs, that sounds OK.

          &raquo;&nbsp;Does our program have to include all 100 observations i.e having 100 circles or can I group them?

            <b>Interesting</b>!<br/>
            We hope that you will show the items individually ... otherwise you could have a single rectangle representing 100 items and simply say that this is <i>my data</i>. That would not be too exciting or expressive.

            Most of the <a href="https://rl.talis.com/3/city/items/5e26c6e4-9c49-4ee8-8115-6cc431ba2f8a.html">Dear Data Weeks</a> show many items and we'd like you to do the same. This kind of <i>detailed depiction</i> gives you the best chance of making an interesting <i>discovery</i>.
          </p>
          <p>
            We would also encourage you to collect plenty of data for each observation, as once again more detail gives you more possibilities for <i>expressive depiction</i> and <i>interesting discovery</i>.

            <p><b>A-ha!</b> The module playlist ...</p>

            <p>
              On <i>Monday</i> I played <i><a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/6hHc7Pks7wtBIW8Z6A0iFq">Blue Monday</a></i>, because it was Monday, it's excellent and in parts it is achievable with the <a href="https://jsndyks.github.io/cityCreativeCoding/p5js/jwo/stepSequencer/">Step Sequencer</a>. Have a go!             
            </p>

          <p>Talking of '<i>Go!</i>' ... when I asked you to <i>Go!</i> and get on with some coding tasks I played <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/2cNjgoSh1TBHFQIhfzRJUE"><i>Go</i></a> by <i>The Chemical Brothers</i> because it also has a <a href="https://jsndyks.github.io/cityCreativeCoding/p5js/jwo/stepSequencer/">Step Sequencer</a> style about it (and has <i>Tour de France</i> connotations too).</p>

          <p>The cat - ah, that was <i>Serge Gainsbourg</i> and <i>Jane Birkin</i>'s inimitable and inappropriately steamy <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/5P0tWr5JZqDoi5wq2OalFH"></a><i>Je t'aime, moi non plus</i></a> which was intended to convey the love hate relationship I have with the cat, which provides plenty of cuddles but also bites me, urinates in my plant pots, frequently decapitates rabbits on the carpet and routinely destroys my seedlings.</p>
          
          <p>In the <i>final session</i> I almost played <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/3850dYVgOFIXJh5U4BFEWH">Hung Up</a> because it was in my head following an spectacular <a href="https://abbavoyage.com">evening in East London</a> and felt a little safer than humming along to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/3vkQ5DAB1qQMYO4Mr9zJN6">the track it samples from</a>.</p>
