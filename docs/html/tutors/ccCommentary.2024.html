        <h2>Year 1 Personal Tutorials &amp; #CreativeCoding Commentary Task</h2>
            

            <h4>Short Story</h4>
                <h5>Context</h5>
                <!---p>Briefings on the other activities will be provided as term progresses, but see the table above for an overview.</p--->
                <p>You'll remember that students have been asked to produce ...
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                    A Processing sketch<br/>
                    that depicts a data set that they have collected over time<br/>
                    that explores some aspect of the World<br/>
                    that is interesting to them
                </blockquote>
                <p>Hopefully ...</p>
                <blockquote>
                    in creative &amp; expressive ways <br/>
                    that they are pleased with and<br/>
                    that helps them learn (a little) about themselves &amp; The World around them
                </blockquote>

                <p>... and that if they do this and a couple of other things, they have been promised get a <i>Digital Badge</i> for <code>#CreativeCoding</code> that they can display and share on social media along with a short summary of their efforts: a <b>Creative Coding Commentary</b>?</p>

                <h5>Action</h5>

                <p>Well, <b>100 students</b> completed the voluntary task, about 1/4 of them.</p>
                    
                <p>Tutors now need write a few sentences describing <em>each of the submitting students'</em> initiative, participation, creativity, &amp; group-work capability in the <code>#CreativeCoding</code> activity and tutorials. This is the <em>Creative Coding Commentary</em> that we promised that <em>Stage 1 Personal Tutors</em> would produce.
                    
                <p>We need a few short sentences that are intended to provide them with some encouragement, and you with some colour and individual 'data' to help you (or a colleague) with convincing reference writing down the line.
                </p>

            <h4>Full Story</h4>

                <h5>Here's How To Do It ...</h5>

                <p>The <em>Workload Model</em> gives us 20 mins <em>per tutee</em> for this task, so we hope that you can use this time to ...</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Check the <a href="https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/mod/page/view.php?id=854620">List of Submitting Students</a> to see who has submitted from your Stage 1 Tutor Group</li>

                    <li>Have a look at the <a href="https://cityuni-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/j_dykes_city_ac_uk/El9zYEPV1F5Ks3j4n1xsb2UBGLga2QbtAIdbykLFI3ch8g?e=NCaqDK">Dear Data Sketch Submissions</a> for each of these students;</li>

                    <li>Draft <em>a brief commentary</em>, based upon the submission and your engagement with them through the process;</li>

                    <li>Log the commentary on <a href="https://evision.city.ac.uk">e:Vision</a>;</li>

                    <li>Send a brief e-mail to the students to let them know that you have completed the commentary, with a copy of the text, any feedback on the submission and some congratulations on having submitted.
                    If you are going to the <em>Pizza &amp; Data Party</em> then encourage them to come along.</li>
                </ol>

                <p>Details follow ...</p>

                <h5>Submitted Files</h5>

                <p>You'll find two folders for each students who has submitted here:</p> 
                <ul><li><a href="https://cityuni-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/j_dykes_city_ac_uk/El9zYEPV1F5Ks3j4n1xsb2UBGLga2QbtAIdbykLFI3ch8g?e=NCaqDK">Dear Data Sketch Submissions</a></li></ul>

                <p>These are ...</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <code>StudentName_ ... _<b>onlinetext</b></code>,<br/>
                        A web page that offers a short commentary on the effort.<br/>
                        This should be in a file called <code>onlinetext.html</code> - click and see!
                    </li>
                    <li><code>StudentName_ ... _<b>file</b></code>, which contains:
                        <ul>
                            <li>a <b>screen dump</b> - so you can see something of what was produced.<br/><em>This may be all you need</em>;</li>
                            <li>

                            an <b>archive</b> - containing code and data, that you can unpack (double click?), run and play with.<br/>
                            <em>Do this if you like, no need.</em><br/>
                            It might run in <a href="https://processing.org/download">Processing</a> if you are lucky. <br/>
                            If it doesn't - then make sure that <code>filename.pde</code> is in a folder called <code>filename</code>.<br/>
                            So <code>ccProj.pde</code> must be in a <code>ccProj</code> folder (<code>./ccProj/ccProj.pde</code>)<br/>
                            If that doesn't work ... <b>give up</b>.
                        </li>
            
                        </ul></li>
                </ul>
                
                
                <h5>Drafting the Text</h5>
               
                <p>This is just a chance to say something that is <i>positive</i>, <i>personal</i> and <i>compact</i> about the student and their efforts that you (or somebody else) might draw upon when writing a reference.</p>
                <p>Focus on their <i>initiative</i>, <i>participation</i>, <i>creativity</i>, &amp; <i>group-work capability</i> in the <code>#CreativeCoding</code> activity and the tutorials that you ran.<br/>
                Try to be specific about their choice of topic and data collection, and any reflection that occurred.</p>

                <p>The <em>four</em> examples that I have written are copied below (anonymised) in an Appendix.<br/>
                    Feel free to use words, structure or nothing at all from these to inspire your efforts.</p>
                
                <h5>Logging on e:Vision</h5>

                <p>Once you have your text, it's relatively easy (given what a pain <em>e:Vision</em> is) to log this.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>e:Vision - <a href="https://evision.city.ac.uk/)">https://evision.city.ac.uk/</a></li>
                </ul>

                <h5>The Reward</h5>

                <p>We're grateful for the effort that people have put into this activity and so as well as bumping up your WA and optionally filling you with <em>University Catering Pizza</em> you will receive ...</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>a <b>Digital Badge</b> - some people got a little upset by my issuing of self-awarded imaginary medals last term, so I should know better, but I am sending you a slightly tongue-in-cheek <i>digital badge</i> from our <em>OpenBadgeFactory</em> facility so that you can see how this works and what the students received.<br/>
                        Remember, this reward system was suggested as an incentive by students and is supported by the University.
                        Some students already have these on their <i>LinkedIn</i> pages. We might find it useful for some activities.
                    <br/>If you want to know more, or discuss ideas, get in touch.</li>
                    <li>a <b>Physical NoteBook</b> - we have ordered <code>#CreativeCoding</code> notebooks for all tutors to say 'thanks'. They are very nice items, and you can pick them up either at the <em>Pizza &amp; Data Party</em>, or, if you can't make that or are one of those people who doesn't like Pizza, or Students, or both or to handle books with sticky fingers then please pick up from <i>Asif Nawaz</i> in A304.</li>
                </ol>

                <p>That really is it - until we ask for <em>feedback</em> from you and the students to feed into next year's planning.</p>

    <h5>Student 1 : Phone Shapes</h5>

<h6>Creative Coding Commentary</h6>
<p>
    S1 participated well in our first year Creative Coding activity, a voluntary course that required (and encouraged) creative thinking and relied upon some personal data collection and autonomous study.
</p>
<p>
    She/he attended and contributed well to tutorials and showed some capability as a creative coder - we used Processing to learn to code and produce output quickly that helped stimulate discussion about data and self.
</p>
<p>    
    She/he produced a Dear Data Diary showing his/her phone use over a week and used classes to capture, display and analyze this information effectively in an original interactive sketch.
    There were some nice ideas in his/her visualization, which was elegant,  expressive and revealing - Friday seemed to be particularly busy time!
</p>
<p>    
    S1 was a committed, capable and motivated creative coder and his/her efforts helped him/her to reflect on the notion of data as "material" that is a starting point for play, expression and learning in ways that the Dear Data book encourages.
</p>

<h6>E-Mail</h6>
<pre style="background-color:#ffffff; font-size:80%">Hi S1, nice work!

I like the combination of shapes and colors … and wonder whether we can see anything in here?
Lots of blue? Not much red? Not many circles?

I like the way shape complexity is ordered to show day sequence, but is this easy to detect and interpret in the graphic? I’m not sure. 

The code looks pretty good - nice use of a class and drawPolygon() is an elegant solution.

Ways to improve things :

 - get the Shape functionality into the Shape class - draw() etc.
   Objects can contain data and methods
 - separate data from code - see the notes and use loadStrings();
 - try to remove numbers from your code - use variables or parameters (e.g. clickCount < 7 could be clickCount < 7 ArrayList.size())
 - make sure you  understand ArrayLists - I think you only need one of these here
 - the randomness makes it interesting, but could you check on shape positions to avoid overlap?
 - a legend and explanation would be handy!

You can probably think of other things too.

Well done on submitting such a nice piece of work.
I hope you got the CC Badge and will come and show your work at the Pizza & Data Party.

Jason.</pre>



        <h5>Student 2 : Movie Spirals</h5>
<h6>Creative Coding Commentary</h6>
<p>
    S2 participated well in our first year Creative Coding activity, a voluntary course that required (and encouraged) creative thinking and relied upon some personal data collection and autonomous study.
</p><p>
    She/he attended and contributed well to tutorials and showed some capability as a creative coder - we used Processing to learn to code and produce output quickly that helped stimulate discussion about data and self.
</p><p>
    The Dear Data Diary that she/he created was compelling, using a variety of code constructs to effectively depict and reveal his/her movie-watching habits. She/he created classes to capture, display and an analyze this information effectively in an original interactive animated sketch.
    There were some very nice ideas in his/her visualization - with spinning spirals showing his/her viewing habits in ways that were expressive, impressive and revealing!
</p><p>
    S2 was a committed, capable and motivated creative coder and his/her efforts helped him/her to reflect on the notion of data as "material" that is a starting point for play, expression and learning in ways that the Dear Data book encourages.    
</p>

<h6>E-Mail</h6>
<pre style="background-color:#ffffff; font-size:80%">Hi S2,

This is great - a really compelling visualization that is interesting, expressive and informative.
Did you find anything out?

The code looks pretty good - nice use of a class to capture data, good use of arrays, loops, conditionals and functions, and you use external sources well too (but be sure to tell us where the image came from and the licensing conditions). Excellent animation - very nice.

Ways to improve things :

    - you could use methods in your class to do some of the drawing and scaling.
    - separate data from code - see the notes and use loadStrings();
    - this feels like a great place to add some sound (maybe a scream or two?)

I’m sure you can think of other things as well!

This really was a great piece of work, I enjoyed playing with it and thinking about it.
Well done on submitting such a good Dear Data Diary.
I hope you got the CC Badge and will come and show your work at the Pizza & Data Party.

        <h5>Student 3 : Walking Bars</h5>
<h6>Creative Coding Commentary</h6>
<p>
    S3 participated well in our first year Creative Coding activity, a voluntary course that required (and encouraged) creative thinking and relied upon some personal data collection and autonomous study.
<p></p>
    She/he attended and contributed well to tutorials and showed excellent commitment to the project and some capability as a creative coder.
<p></p>
    She/he produced a Dear Data Diary showing his/her walking activity over a month (93 walks!) and developed Java classes to capture, display and analyze this information effectively in an original interactive animated sketch.
</p><p>
    There were some nice ideas in his/her visualization, which was elegant, expressive and impressive in many ways. It acted as a means of reflecting on the notion of data as "material" that is a starting point for play, expression and learning in ways that the Dear Data book encourages.
<p></p>
    S3 was a committed, capable and motivated creative coder and his/her outputs were revealing and impressive.</p>
</p>

    <h6>E-Mail</h6>
<pre style="background-color:#ffffff; font-size:80%">Hi S3, nice work!

I was impressed with the data collection (and the walking) and that you did something original with it that was animated and interactive.

It was a shame that you didn’t add any explanatory text - did you learn anything?

There is quite a lot of information in the JSON:
    - I wonder how your speed varied, how your calorie count accumulated and whether there is a relationship between steps and speed and calories?

Feel free to keep exploring the data and well done on collecting and coding so much. 

You should have received your badge, I hope so - please let me know.
You should also have seen the invite to the event on Friday. I hope you can come along, show your efforts and see what others have been up to as well.
Remember to be encouraging to your peers - people have done some very varied and really interesting things!
It would be good to see you there.

Best!

Jason.</pre>

        <h5>Student 4 : Drink Flowers</h5>
<h6>Creative Coding Commentary</h6>
<p>
    S4 participated well in our first year Creative Coding activity, a voluntary course that required (and encouraged) creative thinking and relied upon some personal data collection and autonomous study.
</p><p>
    She/he attended and contributed well to tutorials and showed some capability as a creative coder - we used Processing to learn to code and produce interesting output quickly that helped stimulate discussion about data and self.
</p><p>
    The Dear Data Diary that she/he created was compelling, effectively employing classes to develop attractive graphics in which a series of animated flowers showed when she/he had consumed hot drinks, what these were, and who had made them.
    This information was stylistically represented in an original interactive sketch that demonstrated creative thinking and coding capability through his/her visualization.
</p><p>
    S4 was a committed, capable and motivated creative coder and his/her efforts helped him/her to reflect on the notion of data as "material" that is a starting point for play, expression and learning in ways that the Dear Data book encourages.    
</p>
<h6>E-Mail</h6>
<pre style="background-color:#ffffff; font-size:80%">Hi S4,

Great idea, and a compelling visualization despite your data set being pretty small. Nevertheless you showed some excellent creative coding - highlights including:

    - the use of classes;
    - the separation of data and code;
    - interaction and animation;
    - it looks great!;

Your flowers capture lots of data and you use ArrayLists and loops and conditions very effectively.
Employing animation (rotation) as a means of conveying information was very creative and worked nicely.

Ways to improve things :

    - you could use methods in your class to do some of the drawing and scaling, objects contain functionality as well as data - drawFlower() for example might have been a method in Flower called with flower.drawFlower();
    - there is quite a lot of action in keyPressed() and we would normally try to just change state variables in there and act on these in the main draw() loop;
    - constraining the flowers to the screen might have been a good idea (maybe)
    - some more data might have made a more compelling visualization

I’m sure you can think of other things as well!

This really was an impressive piece of work.
Well done on submitting such a good Dear Data Diary.
I hope you got the CC Badge and will come and show your work at the Pizza & Data Party.
