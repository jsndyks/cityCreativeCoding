        <h2>Year 1 Personal Tutorials &amp; #CreativeCoding</h2>
            
        <p>We are running our new <code>#CreativeCoding</code> activity across term for the Year 1 CS students.
            It replaces the <code>#BootCamp</code> that used to fill the first two weeks with intensive expensive fun and games.
            If you know <code>#BootCamp</code>, it's broadly the same, with re-appropriated material, but with more time and a different output.</p>
        <p><code>#CreativeCoding</code> is not a module, and is not assessed, but runs in <b>Hijack Mode</b> in weeks 01, 02, 07 &amp; 08 when it uses the scheduled rooms and TAs of existing timetabled activity. It is also the focus for the Year 1 <i>Personal Tutorials</i> and this is an attempt to brief <i>Personal Tutors</i> on how this works and what is required. </p>

                    The students' sketches will tell us something about their activity and interest as they collect data about themselves through term.

                <p>The <b>minimum</b> we ask is that you connect with your tutees and book meetings as scheduled.<br/>
                    They should be in the same practical class group and you should be able to see this on <a href="https://mytimetable.city.ac.uk/">MyTimetable</a> and so work around it.</p>
                <p>We recommend using the <a href="https://outlook.office.com/bookings/">Bookings</a> feature in Office, which works extremely well.</p>
                <p>We suggest that you book all of the tutorials right away and get them in your diary and the students' diaries.</p>
                <h5>Tutorial 1</h5>
                <p>All you need to do in weeks 01 or 02 is say Hello, do some introductions and <b>ask</b> the students what they need to do in <code>#CreativeCoding</code>. Let them explain their learning.</p>
                <p>They should be trying to come up with a <i>Dear Data Diary</i> ... collecting data about their lives that is based around some topic:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>the topic must be <b>original</b> and <b>unique</b> - <i>they have been given some creativity techniques, get them to explain and use these</i></li>
                    <li>the topic must be something that interests and / or is <b>meaningful</b> to them - <i>ask them why it matters! Get them to discuss this and what they are collecting about the topic - and how it is going!</i></li>
                    <li>the data must not reveal identifying personal information - be <b>anonymous</b>  <i>you can advise on this and discuss potential for identity leak</i></li>
                    </ul>
                <p>Please help them make a judgment here - pretty much anything goes!<br/>
                    Ask them to explain why this is <b>meaningful</b> to them, why it is likely to be <b>original</b> and to reassure you about steps taken to ensure <b>anonymity</b>.</p>
                <p>If you are unable to answer anything, or receive questions about <code>#CreativeCoding</code>, then get them to me in an email with <code>CC24</code> in the subject field please.</p>
                <p>Briefings on the other activities will be provided as term progresses, but see the table above for an overview.</p>

Selecting, annotating and prioritising resources seems to me to be absolutely core academic activity, that is extremely useful for students. Letting them know what they should read, and why, and giving them access to it is a fantastic way of getting our knowledge to them. If you don't produce annotated, ordered reading lists, then I strongly encourage you to do so - it works extremely well and the library provide great support.

                <p>Remember that <i>Giorgia Lupi</i> and <i>Stefanie Posavec</i> remind us of a view in which:</p>
                <blockquote>Data is a starting point for questioning and understanding the world around us.<br/>It is not the definitive answer to all of our questions. </blockquote>
                <p>So it‚Äôs a good place to start a degree, and a good medium through which you might get to know yourself, your students, your role as their tutor and your relationship with them.</p>
