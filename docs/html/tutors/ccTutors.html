        <h2>Year 1 Personal Tutorials &amp; #CreativeCoding</h2>
            
        <div>
        <p>Once again we are running our <code>#CreativeCoding</code> activity across this term for the Year 1 CS students.<br/>
        <i>Giacomo</i>, <i>Golnaz</i> and I will be leading with support in the labs from <i>Olga</i>, <i>Aravin</i>, <i>Charlie</i> and <i>Sofiia</i>.</p>

        <p><code>#CreativeCoding</code> is not a module - it is an <i>activity</i>, and it is not assessed - though students are encouraged to create a <i>submission</i> that enables them to experiment with code and data. 
        It runs in <b>Hijack Mode</b> in weeks 01, 02, 07 &amp; 08, when it uses the scheduled rooms of existing timetabled activities for lectures and practical classes (plus a couple of extra sessions too). It also aligns with and is indeed the focus for the Year 1 <i>Personal Tutorials</i> organised by <i>Dha</i>, and this document is an attempt to brief <i>Personal Tutors</i> on how this will work and what is required.</p>
        </div>

            <div class="unit-70">
        <p>You will note <b>Four Touch-Points</b> when <i>Personal Tutorials</i> will connect with the <code>#CreativeCoding</code> activity.<br/>After meeting tutees in induction week (week 00) there will be 2x group and 2x individual personal tutorials before a (yet to be scheduled) end of term party in week 12. See the <span style="font-size:67%; padding:0.25rem; padding-left:1rem; padding-right:1rem; background-color:#FEF2CC;color:#444"><i>yellow row</i></span> above, which shows the teo-week period in which tutorials should be scheduled.</p>

            <div class="unit-70">
                <p>We are asking you to discuss <code>#CreativeCoding</code> activity with the students during these sessions across term. Get to know them a little by discussing and engaging with the concepts that they learn about, data they collect and the portfolios that they make. Prompt them, ask them, see what they are up to - what they can and can't do, what they find challenging.</p>
                <p>There is a "<i>getting to know you</i>" angle in the first term  - getting to know yourself and each other through data and its creative representation - inspired by <i>Giorgia Lupi</i> &amp; <i>Stef Posavec</i>'s wonderful <a href="https://www.dear-data.com/theproject">Dear Data</a> project.<br/>
                    The students' will produce <i>Dear Data 100</i> demos across term, and learn the <i>Processing</i> code to do so in simple 'sketches'. They will need to collect <i>100 data items</i> about something that is meaningful to them and visualize these.<br/> 
                    This will tell us something about their activity and interests as they collect data about themselves through term.
                    Keen tutors may be so overwhelmingly excited by all of this that they decide to participate in the exercise themselves.</p>

                    <p>At the end of term you will be asked to produce a short summary of your tutees' efforts: a <b>Creative Coding Commentary</b> that involves a few sentences describing their initiative, participation, creativity, &amp; group-work capability in the <code>#CreativeCoding</code> activity and first term of tutorials.</p>
                    <p>This is intended to motivate students and provide a few useful reminders, that have a personal angle, for future reference writing. It is generously workloaded in the WAM.</p>

                    <p>This document explains what is required of you as a personal tutor, outlining the minimum that is required and  and offers some ideas that may inspire you to take things a little further. It makes no mention at all of <i>medals</i>: either real or imaginary.</p>

                <p>The students have been encouraged to find <i>Fib Friends</i> with the same number from the sequence, the same badge, and exchange names and share two meaningful pieces of information about each other when they do so.
                    Ask them how they are getting on with this when you see them!
                Have they found a <i>Fib Friend</i>? How might they do so?</p>

                <p><b>The <i><u>minimum</u></i> we ask is that you connect with your tutees and book meetings as scheduled.</b><br/>
                    They should all be in the same practical class group and you should be able to see this scheduled on <a href="https://mytimetable.city.ac.uk/">MyTimetable</a> and so work around it.</p>
                <p>The group tutorials will be organised by Edward as the induction week ones were and <i>timetabled</i>.<br/>
                    You will need to arrange the individual tutorials yourself.<br/> 
                    We recommend using the <a href="https://outlook.office.com/bookings/">Bookings</a> feature in Office, which works extremely well.
                It's also a great idea to set up a group containing all of your tutees, so that you can communicate with them reliably and easily.</p>
                <p>We suggest that you book the individual tutorials for this term <i>right away</i> and get them in your diary and the students' diaries.</p>

                <h5>Tutorial 1 - Group (50 mins - ish)</h5>
                <p>All you need to do in weeks 02 or 03 is say Hello, do some introductions and <b>ask</b> the students what they need to do in <code>#CreativeCoding</code>. Let them explain their learning.</p>
                <p>They should be trying to come up with a <i>Dear Data 100</i> focus, collecting data about their lives that is based around some topic:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>the topic should be <b>original</b> and <b>unique</b> - <i>they have been given some creativity techniques, get them to explain and use these</i></li>
                    <li>the topic must be something that interests and / or is <b>meaningful</b> to them - <i>ask them why it matters! Get them to discuss this and what they are collecting about the topic - and how it is going! What are they trying to find out?</i></li>
                    <li>the data must not reveal identifying personal information - be <b>anonymous</b>  <i>you can advise on this and discuss potential for identity leak</i></li>
                    </ul>
                <p>Please help them make a judgment here - pretty much anything goes! Just be encouraging.<br/>
                    Ask them to explain why this is <b>meaningful</b> to them, why it is likely to be <b>original</b> and to reassure you about steps taken to ensure <b>anonymity</b>.</p>
                <p>If you are unable to answer anything, or receive questions about <code>#CreativeCoding</code>, then remind students about the <i>Creative Coding Discussion Forum</i> on Moodle or get them to contact me in an email with <code>CC25</code> in the subject field please.</p>
                <p>Please send questions about this activity and / or feedback once it has happened to me with <code>CC25</code> in the subject field. Constructive feedback would be very much appreciated.</p>

                <h5>Tutorial 2 - Individual (15 mins)</h5>

                <p>This is an <i>individual session</i> - spend 15 minutes with each tutee discussing their progress.</p>
                <p>It would be good to <i>see a sketch or too</i> (laptops out, pre-warn them about this) and ask about their progress.<br/>
                We would like them to show an <i>interactive method</i> that they have produced and demonstrate <i>evidence of some data collection</i> for their developing <i><a href="https://jsndyks.github.io/cityCreativeCoding/html/dearData/ccDataDiaries.2024.html">Dear Data 100</a></i> sketch - encourage them to settle on a theme.</p>
                <p>Please remind them that they will receive a personal paragraph that describes their approach to and engagement with the <code>#CreativeCoding</code> activity. You are looking to see initiative, participation, creativity, and group-work capability in the tutorials and would like to write something positive that captures their abilities, approach and engagement, and that is personal - relying upon their <i>Dear Data 100</i> ideas.</p>
                <p>Encourage them to use <i>Git</i> and ask them about their <i>Git</i> repository (and maybe give them a nudge).
                There is a <a href="https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/mod/page/view.php?id=795676">Git Guide</a> with videos and the <i>City Computer Science Society</i> also provides <a href="https://www.css-city.com/se#session-0">Git Session</a> tutorials.</p>

                <p>Now, of course this may lead to, or be overtaken by, more pressing personal tutorial issues ... and in a way, this is the point.
                <code>#CreativeCoding</code> is a bit of an icebreaker, a way to connect with the students and for students to get to know tutors. 
                Use your judgment to decide where to focus the tutorial, you can always ask them back during office hours or send them to the TA practical labs, but do try to encourage the students to participate in <code>#CreativeCoding</code> if you can - and remind them of the next tutorials in weeks 08 or 09 when they will need to show their data depicted in objects.
                We introduce some exciting capabilities for using sound and video in their sketches in week 07, so they will need to be up to date with the learning material by then - and have some data! Encourage them to prepare for this - the materials are already online on Moodle.</p>

                <p>Incidentally, if students are not engaging, and not all of them will, then chat about other tings, including <i>motivation</i>.
                    This page on <a href="https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/mod/page/view.php?id=817952">What's The Point?!</a> might provide some prompts</p>

                <div style="background-color:#f8f8f8; padding:0.5em">
                <h6>Tips for Engagement</h6>
                <p>How to get your students to come to the 1:1 tutorials!</p>
                <ol>
                <li>Check <a href="https://mytimetable.city.ac.uk/schedule">MyTimetable</a> to find gaps in their timetable when they (and you) are available.</li>
                <li>Then use the <a href="https://outlook.office.com/bookings">Outlook Bookings</a> feature to allow them to book a 15 minute session with you during this time - you can set this up to send reminders half an hour beforehand.<br/>
                    I find '<i>use customised availability hours</i>' particularly useful as you can be very specific about when meetings can occur</li>
                <li>In <i>Outlook</i> you can create a group for your tutees and send a message just to this group - <a href="https://outlook.office.com/groups/">Outlook Groups</a>.
                Outlook automatically filters it into a folder with the group name.<br/>My tutees saw the message because it appeared in the group, not in their overfull inbox (which contains all the discussion messages sent in every module and so is largely unusable!).</li>
                </ol>
                 </div>

                <h5>Tutorial 3 - Individual (15 mins)</h5>

                <p>This is a second <i>individual session</i> - spend 15 minutes with each tutee, using some prompting around their progress to get to know them and enable them to raise any issues that they would like to discuss.</p>
                <p>Ask them to show you their sketchbook and in particular <i>discuss a sketch that contains an object (and a class) that they have written</i>.</p>
                <p>Hopefully this will be a class <i>that enables them to show some of the data that they have been collecting</i>. Some discussion around the concepts of classes and instances, and how their class models and represents their data, which models and represents some aspect of <i>The World</i> might ensue. Or you could talk about something completely different - just be your usual friendly, open, accessible self and reinforce your position as <i>their academic point of contact</i>.</p>
                <p>If they have not made much progress, remind them that it is very straightforward to create a simple <code>class</code> and that the <a href="https://jsndyks.github.io/cityCreativeCoding/html/objects/ccObjects.robots.html">Robots Example Page</a> explains it on a step by step basis.</p>
                <p>Check that data collection is progressing and discuss their developing sketchbook and ultimate ideas for data visualization - which they may sketch for you in their notebooks, or on your whiteboard.
                </p>
                <p>Next!</p>

                <h5>Tutorial 4 - Group (50 mins - ish)</h5>
                <!---p>Briefings on the other activities will be provided as term progresses, but see the table above for an overview.</p--->
                <p>Please schedule a group session in week 10 or 11 to share, compare and discuss sketches, data sets, progress and ambition and reflect a little on what has been achieved ... before the showcase party ... which will be <b>in January after the exams</b>.
                    <i>(You will be invited)</i></p>
                </p>
                <h6>BRIEFLY:</h6>
                <p>
                    Students have been asked to produce ...
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                    A <i>Processing</i> sketch<br/>
                    that depicts a data set that they have collected over time<br/>
                    that explores some aspect of the World<br/>
                    that is interesting to them<br/>
                    through at least 100 observations
                </blockquote>
                <p>Hopefully ...</p>
                <blockquote>
                    in creative & expressive ways <br/>
                    that they are pleased with and<br/>
                    that helps them learn (a little) about themselves &amp; The World around them
                </blockquote>

                <p>The week 10 / 11 group tutorial should be in your calendar:

                <p>Your role is to get them together (sigh - but see <i>Tips for Engagement</i> above), host this discussion and be super encouraging.</p>

                <p>Ask them questions that prompt discussion and that help you figure out what is going on, but if they have questions ... push them to the <i>Creative Coding Discussion Forum on Moodle</i>.<br/><b>You don't need to answer questions about <i>Processing</i>, the module or submissions!</b> That's on the teaching team. And we are on the discussion forum. The TAs are still running drop-in sessions too.</p>
                <p>
                Try to use this group tutorial as an opportunity to be encouraging and to get to know the students a bit ... maybe even through their data. Be sure to let them know that you are impressed and that you either don't code, or have trouble with bugs, or whatever - just be empathic! Please congratulate them on a productive term - they really have done pretty well in many cases.</p>

                <p>Importantly, encourage them to make a submission on Moodle before the deadline in <i>Week 11</i> - <b>11th December</b>, and let them know that anything is fine. A thing is a success. There is no failure here, just participation.
                <br/>If they do this and a couple of other things, they will get a <i>Digital Badge</i> for <code>#CreativeCoding</code> that they can display and share on social media.
                <!-- Discussions with last year's students indicated that this would be motivating. -->
            </p>

                <p>Please pepper me with questions - I am trying to make this manageable and interesting for you with limited preparation on your behalf.
                    So let me know if there is anything that you need to know.
                    <i>Freestyle</i> as much as you want to in the tutorial - but try to get them talking about themselves, their data, their efforts to code.<br/>
                    You should know them a little by now, you may even know some of the sketches.<br/>
                    Students who submit will also receive a short summary of their efforts: a <b>Creative Coding Commentary</b> in which <i>you will be asked to write a few sentences describing their initiative, participation, creativity, &amp; group-work capability in the <code>#CreativeCoding</code> activity and tutorials</i>.<br/>
                    So this is a good time / place for you to gather a bit of data about what they have been up to ... and <i>you may want to jot down a few notes afterwards</i>.<br/>
                    You can do the <b>Creative Coding Commentaries</b> whenever you want, but probably best to wait for submissions first, and we will need the text <i>by the end of January</i>. Remember, these commentaries involve a few short sentences that are intended to provide you with some colour and individual 'data' to help you with reference writing down the line.<br/>
                    They are workloaded.<br/>
                    As ever, thanks for the feedback and ideas. Keep them coming.
                </p>

                <h5>That's it! (phew)</h5>

                <p>That's all - hopefully you can used these instructions and the <code>#CreativeCoding</code> focus to get to know and nurture a few bright young people who have potential and help them on their way.<br/>Tey need you, and they need to know and trust you.<br/>Please send me thoughts, suggestions, reactions and questions.</p>

                   A quick way in is to invest a little time in these three <b>short</b> resources that collectively involve about <b>15 minutes of reading &amp; watching.</b>

Selecting, annotating and prioritising resources seems to me to be absolutely core teaching activity, that is extremely useful for students. Letting them know what they should read, and why, and giving them access to it is a fantastic way of getting our knowledge to them. If you don't produce annotated, ordered reading lists, then I strongly encourage you to do so - it works extremely well and the library provide great support.

                <p>You might decide to learn a little <i>Processing</i> and get involved with the coding side of <code>#CreativeCoding</code>.</p>

                <p>The best way to do so quickly is to try <i>Dan Shiffman‚Äôs</i> interactive tutorial and then perhaps get the <i>Processing API</i> and then if you are feeling keen ... engage a little with the <code>#CreativeCoding</code> materials online.</p>
