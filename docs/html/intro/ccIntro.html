			<h3>1. How to use these pages</h3>
			<p>
				Before we get going, here are a few guidelines that will help you get the most of out these pages
				during <code>#CreativeCoding</code>. They contain a mixture of information, theory and practical tasks.
				The tasks are probably the most important bit - <code>#CreativeCoding</code> is mostly about <i>doing</i> rather than just
				reading.
				If you want to be a good coder, you need to code!
				And the more you practice the easier it gets.
			</p>

			<h4>Coding tasks</h4>

			<div class="codeTask">
				<p>
				Anything that looks like this is a 'coding task'. This is your chance to have a go doing something
				rather than just reading about it. Usually you should have a go doing the task at that point in the
				page before continuing to read further.</p>
				<p>Use '<a href="https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/mod/page/view.php?id=967974">PAROT Talk</a>' (ðŸ¦œ) as an approach to learning by doing.</p>
				<p>Sometimes we will do these tasks together in the lecture room, but mostly you will do them in the
				lab classes or in your own time before the next lecture.</p>
				<p>Remember, don't just persuade yourself that you <i>could</i> do the task; actually do it.
				<pre>// Coding is how you learn to code; there is no other way.</pre>
				<p>Your teachers and the TAs have spent many hundreds and thousands of hours coding, and made many hundreds and thousands (perhaps millions) of mistakes!
				They still make them - but they have learned plenty through practice, particularly what to do when they make a mistake or get stuck.</p>
				<p>And remember, if you have any problems completing the tasks, you can always ask for help in the lab classes.</p>
			</div>

			<h4>Core tasks</h4>
			<div class="coreTask">
				<p>
				These are 'core tasks' that are not necessarily to do with coding, but are set to directly develop and test the core skills introduced in each session.
				It is easy to skip over them, but we set them because we think it's very important that you complete these tasks.
				During the labs, and as you plan your work, you should prioritise completion of the core tasks and make sure you have completed them before finishing a topic.
			</p>
			<p>
				You have widely differing backgrounds and skills.
				Some of you might race through all the exercises in a lab, but most of you will still have some work left to do at the end of a lab class.
				After the labs, we strongly encourage you to finish <i>all core tasks</i> in your own time as homework.
				University education involves lots of homework, directed learning at your own pace. 
				You will receive lots of homework and tasks to complete under your own steam, and you have plenty of time in your weekly schedule to do this work.
			</p>
			</div>

			<!--
      <h4>Homework tasks</h4>

      <div class="homework">
        These are tasks that have been set as 'homework'. It is important you have a go doing these before the next day
        of classes as we will usually build upon them in the lectures and lab classes that follow.
      </div>
-->

			<h4>Challenges</h4>

			<div class="challenge">
				<p>
				These are <i>Optional</i> coding tasks that are a bit more challenging - they may interest and perhaps stretch those of you who find the core tasks straightforward.
				They may require you to use features and
				techniques that go a bit beyond what we have covered so far in the classes.
				So do have a go trying them, if you are interested and have time, but don't panic if you are unable to complete them. we don't expect all of you to do them, and you don;t need to do them to succeed in <code>#CreativeCoding</code>
			</p><p>
				If you attempt a challenge but find you can't do it, try to work out <i>why</i> you can't.
				Part of learning to program well is being able to identify why something isn't working : <a href="https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/mod/page/view.php?id=967974">PAROT Talk</a>.
			</p>
			</div>

			<h4>Asides</h4>

			<div class="aside">
				<h5>Aside:</h5>
				<p>
				These are background or related notes that are not essential to the main outcomes of the lecture but that you may find interesting or helpful.<br/>
				There are a few scattered about in our <code>#CreativeCoding</code> pages and other resources.<br/>
				Make a note of those that interest you and come back to them later.</p>
			</div>

			<h4>Tips</h4>

			<div class="tip">
				Brief tips or common mistakes will be highlighted like this.<br/>
				Watch out for them as they could save you much time and effort.
			</div>

			<h4>Copying code</h4>

			<p>
				The programs you will be writing with <i>Processing</i> are known as <i>Sketches</i>. In the lecture notes
				you will often see sketch code like that below. You can usually copy the code straight from these
				pages into <i>Processing</i> by selecting the code then using the <code>Edit-&gt;Copy</code> option (or
				<code>Ctrl-C</code>) from your browser and <code>Edit-&gt;Paste</code> (or <code>Ctrl-V</code>) in
				<i>Processing</i>.

void draw()
{
  background(255);
	
  text("Hello Creative Coders",mouseX,mouseY+40);
  circle(mouseX,mouseY,35);
}</pre>
				

			<p>
				We've made it as easy as possible to copy code from these pages directly into <i>Processing</i> so you can
				get sketches quickly up and running.<br/>However, you will not learn to code properly if you simply copy
				code without understanding it.
			</p>
			<div class="tip">
				Outside of the lectures, we generally ask you <i>not</i> to copy and paste any code unless you wrote it in the first place.

			<h3>2. Your first <i>Processing</i> sketch</h3>

			<div class="coreTask">
				<p>Before starting this section make sure you have <i>Processing</i> installed on your computer.</p>
				<p>If you
				haven't done so already, see the instructions for downloading and installing <i>Processing</i> in the first
				section of <a href="https://processing.org/tutorials/gettingstarted/" target="_blank">Getting
				Started with Processing</a></p>
			</div>

			<p>
				By the end of <code>#CreativeCoding</code> you will be producing exciting apps including simple games, interactive graphics and data visualizations with <i>Processing</i>.
				These apps are known as 'sketches' and over the course of this term you will be encouraged to produce a sketchbook full of your own.<br/>
				But first let's start with something simple.
			</p>

			<p class="focusOFF"><code><span class="focusHash">#</span><span class="focusNum">2</span> - <b>First Sketch</b> : Boring Rectangle</code></p>

			<div class="codeTask">
				<h5>A Rather Boring Rectangle</h5>
				<p>Start <i>Processing</i> and type the following line of code.</p>
				<pre class="brush: processing; gutter: false; toolbar: false; ">rect(20,30,70,35);</pre>
				<div style="float:right; padding:4px; border:dashed 1px #a0a0a0; margin:12px"/> <img src="https://jsndyks.github.io/cityCreativeCoding/html/intro/img/cc.runButton.png" width="42" height="42"/></div>

				<p>Then press the 'Run' button to execute the instructions and show your sketch - it's the right-pointing triangle, and might look a bit like this ðŸ‘‰.</p>
				<p>If all goes well you should see a white rectangle on a grey background.</p>

			<p>
				This is hardly the most exciting sketch but it does demonstrate the first important idea behind coding:<br/>
				<i>A computer program is a set
				of precise instructions that gets the machine to do stuff</i></b>.</p>
				<p>In <i>Processing</i> (and in the
				Java and many other languages) those instructions are generally <b>ordered</b> and tell
				the computer how to achieve certain tasks. In this case our simple program consists of a single
				instruction that tells <i>Processing</i> to draw a rectangle (<code>rect</code>) positioned at coordinates
				(20,30) with a width of 70 pixels and a height of 35 pixels.
			</p>

			<p>
				Notice the instructions also include brackets '<code>(</code>' and '<code>)</code>' as well as a
				semicolon '<code>;</code>'at the end. Unlike the English language, punctuation such as brackets and
				semicolons in a computer programming language is critical. If you forget them (and you will at
				some stage), your program will not work. Such errors that are about how the program is written
				(missing punctuation, incorrect word order) are called syntax errors. <b><i>The code you write
				must be free of syntax errors before the computer can understand and run it. </i></b>
			</p>

			<p>In <i>Processing</i> brackets mean <code>(</code> these things are related <code>)</code>. In that sentence, in which I used the <i>English Language</i>, the spaces meant that the four words were separate. In <i>Processing</i> and many other languages used in Computer Science, the spaces do not have that meaning. In <i<>Processing</p> we tend to use commas <code>,</code> to separate most things that are part of an instruction like the one above, and semicolons <code>;</code> to separate instructions. So, <code>(</code> these<code>,</code>things<code>,</code>are<code>,</code>separate <code>)</code>.

			<p>We are interested in creativity.
				Let's vary these instructions to create a rectangle that you think will be <i>unique in the class</i>.
				Have a think, and then enter 4 arguments to the <code>rect()</code> command, that will produce a unique rectangle.
			</p>

			<div class="codeTask">
			<h5>A More Exciting and Original Rectangle</h5>
			<p>Replace your original <code>rect()</code> instruction with new arguments, that you think will not be repeated in class.<br/>
			Think about <i>why</i> this rectangle might be original.</p>
			<pre class="brush: processing; gutter: false; toolbar: false; ">rect(x-coordinate,y-coordinate,wide,high);</pre>
			<p>Note that the rectangle must be fully visible on the <i>Processing</i> canvas - fully within the 100 x 100 square.</p>
			<p>When you have produced a valid rectangle, enter the arguments in this form and we can compare your solution with others:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><a href="https://forms.gle/gmDMq3EdKcY2Z4mAA">Rectangle Argument Collection Form</a></li>

			<p>Here are the 137 rectangles that were entered in class:</p>

			<p>
				To get a better sense of how the <i>Processing</i> language works, lets add a little more to our program:

	<!-- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ -->

	<div class="units-row">
		<div class="unit-70-cc">
			<!-- Left column -->

			<pre class="brush: processing; gutter: false; toolbar: false; ">rect(20,30,70,35);
circle(62,60,40);</pre>
				
				
			<p>
				The second command <code>circle</code> works in a similar way to the first command but this time
				draws an circle centred at position (62,60) with a diameter of 40 pixels.
			</p>

			<p>
				You should be able to spot the pattern in how we are issuing instructions to draw our sketch. The
				first word or 'command' (in blue) states what sort of shape to draw, then four numbers in brackets
				specify the position and size of the shape. Finally the semicolon is used to say we have finished
				issuing the command.
			</p>

			<p>
				You should also notice that the circle appears to be 'on top' of the rectangle. This illustrates an
				important principle that applies to much of our coding: <b><i>Commands are run in the order in which
				we issue the program instructions</i></b>. You can confirm this by simply swapping the order
				of instructions:

			<p>The circle is drawn first, then the rectangle.</p>

			<p>
				As our programs become more sophisticated we will see ways in which we can alter the sequence in
				which commands are executed, but for now it is important not to forget that we can control the order
				in which things happen in our programs by changing the order of coding instructions.

			<div class="codeTask">
				<h5>Avoiding The Overlap</h5>
				<p>Replace your original <code>circle()</code> instruction with new arguments, that will ensure that the circle does not overlap the rectangle.<br/>

				<h5>Aside:</h5>
				<p><i>Processing</i> uses the <i>Java</i> programming language as a way of issuing instructions to the
				computer.</p>
				<p><i>Java</i> is known as an <b>object-oriented language</b> because it encourages you to organise
				your code into units known as <i>objects</i> and <i>classes</i> (more on this later).</p>
				<p>It can also be thought of as a <b>procedural language</b> because it requires you to issue ordered
				instructions on <b>how</b> you want the computer to behave. In contrast, some other programming
				languages are described as <b>declarative</b> because they require you to declare the task you want
				solving rather than how it should be solved.</p>

			<h3>3. The graphical coordinate system</h3>
			<p>
				Our sketches so far have been rather small and unexciting. We can set the size of a sketch with
				another <i>Processing</i> command called, you've guessed it, <code>size</code>. Adding this as the first
				line of our sketch:
			</p>

		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="units-row">
		<div class="unit-70-cc">
			<!-- Row break ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ -->
			<div><div id="highlighter_254290" class="syntaxhighlighter nogutter  processing"><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td class="code"><div class="container"><div class="line number1 index0 alt2"><code class="processing function1">size</code><code class="processing plain">(260,200);</code></div><div class="line number2 index1 alt1"><code class="processing plain">circle(62,60,40);</code></div><div class="line number3 index2 alt2"><code class="processing function1">rect</code><code class="processing plain">(20,30,70,35);</code></div></div></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div>

			<p>
				These three commands draw exactly the same circle and rectangle of the same size, but this time on a larger 'canvas'
				that is 260 pixels wide and 200 tall. The <code>size</code> command is issued once, at the start of your sketch
				since its size would not normally change during its lifetime.
			</p>

			<p>
				You may have noticed that all the commands we have used so far have involved specifying either a
				location on screen (e.g. the position of the circle or rectangle) or the size of something (the
				width and height of the sketch canvas, the rectangle and the circle). They all use the same
				<i>coordinate system</i> - that is a pair of numbers representing distances along the horizontal
				x-axis and the vertical y-axis.
			</p>

		</div> <!-- End of left column -->

			<!-- Right column -->

	<div class="units-row">
		<div class="unit-70-cc">
			<!-- Left column -->

			<p>
				Unlike a conventional set of graph axes, the <i>origin</i> (0,0) of the coordinate system is at the
				top-left, not the bottom-left. So increasing the y-value of a coordinate will move downwards not
				upwards.
			</p>

			<p>
				As we will be doing lots of drawing with <i>Processing</i> during <code>#CreativeCoding</code> it is important you are
				comfortable with the principle of using coordinates to specify location and size. To recap: <b>A
				location of something is specified with two numbers in the order (x,y) that indicate the
				distance from the top-left corner in the horizontal and vertical directions respectively.</b>
				For something to be visible in your sketch the x-value should be between 0 and the width of the
				sketch (as determined by the first number of the <code>size()</code> command) and the y-value should
				be between 0 and the height of the sketch (as determined by the second number of the
				<code>size()</code> command).
			</p>

			<div class="tip">
				<p>Keep your Notebooks and a pen and pencil handy when you are designing your sketches.
				Drawing out what you are intending to do will help you keep track of your coding.
				This is especially valuable as your programs become more complicated.</p>
				<p>We say this repeatedly to students and are always surprised by :</p>
				<ul>
					<li>How few students take the time to draw out their sketches on paper</li>
					<li>How much more efficiently and impressively these students make progress</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Use your sketchbooks!</p>
			</div>


			<p>
				Using our newly enlarged canvas, we can explore some of the other shape drawing commands available
				in <i>Processing</i>. In addition to the rectangle and circle, we can draw triangles, lines and irregular
				quadrilaterals. All use the same coordinate system for specifying either locations of the shape
				(e.g. the centre of a circle; corner of a rectangle; vertices of a triangle or quadrilateral), or
				its size (e.g. width and height of a rectangle or ellipse). The example below is a sketch that draws
				some of these shapes:

			<h3>4. Drawing styles</h3>

			<p>
				So far, our sketches have been a little dull and grey. Thankfully, <i>Processing</i> allows you to style
				the drawing of shapes
				using various colours and line thicknesses. You can do this with the commands ...</p>
				<ul>
				<li><a href="https://processing.org/reference/stroke_.html" target="_blank">stroke()</a>,</li>
				<li><a href="https://processing.org/reference/fill_.html" target="_blank">fill()</a> and</li>
				<li><a href="https://processing.org/reference/strokeWeight_.html" target="_blank">strokeWeight()</a></li>
				</ul>
				<p> ...among others.<br/>
				Unlike the drawing primitives, setting a drawing style doesn't immediately draw something on screen.
				Instead it sets the style of any drawing done in your sketch <i>after the style has been set</i>.
				You can think of it as selecting the colour and type of pen to use before you start drawing something.
			</p>

			<!-- Row break ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ -->

			<p>
				Both the <a href="https://processing.org/reference/stroke_.html" target="_blank">stroke()</a> and
				<a href="https://processing.org/reference/fill_.html" target="_blank">fill()</a> commands require a
				colour to be
				provided inside the brackets that follow. There are plenty of ways of specifying colours, but for
				the moment we will use the
				default (<i>red</i>,<i>green</i>, <i>blue</i>) triplet. The three numbers required specify the three
				colour components and
				are scaled between 0 and 255. So, for example, to set the internal fill colour of a shape to bright
				green, you would use
				<code>fill(0,255,0)</code>. To set the outline colour of the shape to red, you might use
				<code>stroke(255,0,0)</code>.
				If you are not sure how these numbers relate to colours you wish to use, you can always bring up
				Processing's
				<i>color selector</i> from the <code>Tools</code> menu. (Alternatively, there are similar tools on
				the web, such as
				<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_picker.asp" target="_blank">W3 Schools HTML Color Picker</a>.)
			</p>

			<p>
				We can use the same way of defining colours to set the background colour of the entire sketch to
				something a little more
				inspiring than the default grey. We do this with the <a href="https://processing.org/reference/background_.html" target="_blank">background()</a>
				command specifying the background colour we would like inside brackets. For example to set a pale
				blue background we would
				add the following line to the beginning of our sketch:
			</p>

			<pre class="brush: processing; gutter: false; toolbar: false; ">
background(200,200,255);
			</pre>

			<p>
				The thickness of shape outlines that appear on the coloured background can be controlled with the <a href="https://processing.org/reference/strokeWeight_.html" target="_blank">strokeWeight()</a>
				command, requiring a single number in brackets indicating the thickness of the line in pixel units.
				This can be a
				decimal number between 0 and 1 if you wish to use very thin lines (useful for faint outlines). For
				thicker
				lines you can control the appearance of their end points and corners with the
				<a href="https://processing.org/reference/strokeCap_.html" target="_blank">strokeCap()</a> and
				<a href="https://processing.org/reference/strokeJoin_.html" target="_blank">strokeJoin()</a>
				commands.
			</p>

			<p>
				If you don't wish to show any outline at all, you can use the command <a href="https://processing.org/reference/noStroke_.html" target="_blank">noStroke()</a>.
				In a similar way, to show only the outline with no internal fill colour, you can use <a href="https://processing.org/reference/noFill_.html" target="_blank">noFill()</a>.
				If you were to specify both <code>noStroke()</code> and <code>noFill()</code> before drawing
				something, it would not be
				visible at all on screen.

			<p>
				You will notice that our example sketches are getting a little bit more complicated as we add new
				shapes and new
				styling commands. One way of making sure we can keep track of what our sketch does as it gets longer
				is to add
				<i>comments</i> to our code. These are the grey lines that start with a <code>//</code>. Whenever
				you include these two
				symbols, the rest of the line is then ignored by <i>Processing</i> so you are free to write text to explain
				what the code does.
			</p>

			<div class="tip">
				Adding comments to your code will make things <i>much</i> easier when your sketches become more
				complex. They help to remind you
				what you intended to do with your code.

			<h3>5. Adding movement to your sketches</h3>

			<p>
				We can draw shapes, and we can colour them. Now lets look at how we can get our sketches to move. To
				understand how we
				do this, we need to introduce one further programming concept - that of the <i>method</i>.
				We will
				look at methods more
				fully later in <code>#CreativeCoding</code>, but for now we will consider a method as simply a collection of commands
				that are grouped together to do something.
			</p>

			<p>
				<i>Processing</i> has two built-in methods that are usually part of a sketch -
				the <i>setup method</i> and the <i>draw method</i>.
				As the names suggest, the <code>setup()</code> method is used to group together any commands that
				are needed to set up the sketch.
				These typically include things like setting the size of the sketch and sometimes selecting
				the stroke and fill
				colours (assuming they don't change during the lifetime of the sketch).
				The <code>draw()</code> method, as you might expect
				is where we group together all the commands that do our sketch drawing.
			</p>

			<p>
				The code to create these two methods looks like this:
			</p>

			<pre class="brush: processing; gutter: false; toolbar: false; ">void setup()
{
   // Code to set up the sketch goes here.
}

void draw()
{
  // Drawing code goes here.
}</pre>

			<p>
				Both <code>setup()</code> and <code>draw()</code> have the word <code>void</code> in front of them,
				which for the moment we
				will ignore. Notice that neither has the a semicolon at the end (unlike <code>background</code>,
				<code>rect</code>, <code>ellipse</code>
				etc.). Instead they are followed by a pair of curly brackets known as <i>braces</i>. These braces
				define the beginning and
				end of the method. Whenever you place code inside a pair of braces like this, you should indent it
				by two spaces or a tab.
				This will make your code a little easier to read as the indentation helps to make it clear it is
				part of block of code (in
				these examples either the <code>setup()</code> or <code>draw()</code> methods).
			</p>
			<div class="tip">
				<p>Pressing <code>CTRL-T</code> on a Windows machine or <code>COMMAND-T</code> on a Mac, will automatically indent your code and make it more readable.</p>
				<p>Do this regularly!</p>
			</div>

			<p>
				Our sketch then involves adding the commands we wish to both methods.
				Here, for example is code to draw a red rectangle on a yellow background using our two methods:
			</p>

			<p class="focusOFF"><code><span class="focusHash">#</span><span class="focusNum">5</span> - <b>There is no FIVE!</b> : (you killed it on the train))</code></p>

			<p class="focusOFF"><code><span class="focusHash">#</span><span class="focusNum">6</span> - <b>Movement - Setup &amp; Draw</b> : PAROT approach ðŸ¦œ</code></p>

			<pre class="brush: processing; gutter: false; toolbar: false; ">void setup()
{
  size(400,300);
  background(255,236,149);
  fill(203,118,122);
}

void draw()
{
  rect(40,40,120,80);
}</pre>

		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="units-row">
		<div class="unit-70-cc">
			<!-- Row break ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ -->
			<div class="rightCol">
				<script>loadImage('https://jsndyks.github.io/cityCreativeCoding/html/intro/img/processingFlow.png', 610, 700, 'Processing program flow');</script>
				<p>Programme flow in <i>Processing</i>.</p>
			</div>
	
			<p>
				Why do we need to go to the effort of creating these two methods when we could have drawn the same
				sketch directly with
				the <code>size()</code>, <code>background()</code>, <code>fill()</code> and <code>rect()</code>
				commands?
			</p>

			<p>
				The answer lies in an important behaviour of all <i>Processing</i> sketches. Any code placed inside the
				<code>setup()</code> method
				(i.e. placed between the curly braces following the <code>void setup()</code> line) will only ever
				be executed once â€” as soon
				as the sketch is run. However any code inside the <code>draw()</code> method isn't just executed
				once, but <i>repeats 60 times
				a second</i> for as long as the sketch is running.
			</p>

			<p>
				In the simple rectangle sketch above it's hard to notice the sketch being redrawn 60 times a second
				because nothing changes
				on each new redraw. But if we make a simple change so that the rectangle isn't always drawn at
				location (40,40) but instead
				at the current mouse position, we will see the effect of multiple redraws.
			</p>

			<p>
				Replacing the first two numbers in the <code>rect()</code> command with two special words
				<code>mouseX</code> and
				<code>mouseY</code> gives us our first dynamic sketch:
			</p>
			<pre class="brush: processing; gutter: false; toolbar: false; ">void setup()
{
  size(400, 300);
  background(255, 236, 149);
  fill(203, 118, 122);
}

void draw()
{
  rect(mouseX, mouseY, 120, 80);
}</pre>

		</div> <!-- End of left column -->

	</div> <!-- End of row -->



	<!-- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ -->

	<div class="units-row">
		<div class="unit-70-cc">
			<!-- Left column -->

			<p>
				The terms <code>mouseX</code> and <code>mouseY</code> refer to special <i>Processing</i> <i>variables</i> that keep track of the location of the
				mouse pointer in real time as the sketch runs and report the horizontal (<code>mouseX</code>) and vertical (<code>mouseY</code>) coordinates (from the top left of the canvas) in pixel units.
				Every time the code in the <code>draw()</code> method is repeated, <i>Processing</i> will check the values these two special variables and update them.
				Our sketch asks <i>Processing</i> to draw a rectangle at the location represented by them.
			</p>


			<p>
				We will delve a little more deeply into using variables in the next session, but now you should be
				able to draw a range of shapes in a <i>Processing</i> sketch, control their colour and appearance and make
				your sketch respond to changes in the mouse position.

			<h3>6. Exercises</h3>

			<p>
				These first exercises will give you practice at assembling commands inside <i>Processing</i>'s <code>draw()</code>
				and <code>setup()</code> methods to draw collections of simple shapes.
				Attempt as many exercises as you can in class, but don't worry if you don't manage to complete
				all these tasks within the lab session and try to spend time completing the work subsequently.
			</p>
		
			<div class="codeTask">
				<p>
				Start with the moving rectangle sketch from the lecture notes (reproduced below).
				For this task it is acceptable to copy and paste the code directly into <i>Processing</i> (using the Edit Copy / Paste menus or keyboard shortcuts
				<code>Ctrl-C</code> and <code>Ctrl-V</code>). Run the sketch to check it works as expected.
			</p>
				<pre class="brush: processing; gutter: false; toolbar: false; ">// Sketch to draw a rectangle that follows the mouse.
void setup()
{
	size(400, 300);
	background(255, 236, 149);
	fill(203, 118, 122);
}

void draw()
{
	rect(mouseX, mouseY, 120, 80);
}</pre>
				<p>
				Try moving the <code>background()</code> line from <code>setup()</code> to the beginning of
				<code>draw()</code> (after the opening brace <code>{</code> but before the <code>rect()</code>line).</p>
					<ul>
						<li>What effect does this have on the sketch when you run it?</li>
						<li>Why is this?</li>
						<li>What happens when you move the <code>fill()</code> line to different parts of the sketch?</li>
						</ul>
			</div>

			<div class="codeTask">
				<p>Create a new sketch called 'Underground'.<br/>Start with a blank page: strictly NO copy and paste for this task.
				</p>
				<p>
				Add the usual <code>setup()</code> and <code>draw()</code> methods to your sketch.<br/>
				In <code>setup()</code>, set the sketch window size to 600 pixels wide by 400 pixels high.<br/>
				In <code>draw()</code>, add code that draws a London underground symbol in the centre of the sketch window, similar to this:

				of one or more of the numbers you would normally provide with a processing command.
				</p>
				<p><i>Hint:</i> if you use the mouse position to control colours, it may be convenient to size your sketch 256
				x 256, so that the values of <code>mouseX</code> and <code>mouseY</code> are always in the range 0--255

			<h3>7. Summary and Further Information</h3>

			<ul class="summary">
				<li>
					A computer program is a series of precisely defined instructions that gets the computer to do
					something.
				</li>

				<li>
					<i>Processing</i> is a variation of the <i>Java</i> programming language focussed on creating graphical and
					interactive applications known as <i>sketches</i>.
				</li>

				<li>
					A <i>Processing</i> command usually consists of a keyword (such as <code>rect</code> or
					<code>size</code>) followed by brackets,
					some numbers and a semicolon.
				</li>

				<li>
					The order of program instructions is important â€” within a block of code instructions are
					executed in sequence from top to bottom.
				</li>

				<li>Most <i>Processing</i> sketches contain at least two special <i>methods</i> â€”<code>setup()</code>, which contains the one-off setting up instructions, and <code>draw()</code>, which contains the instructions repeated 60 times a second.</li>
