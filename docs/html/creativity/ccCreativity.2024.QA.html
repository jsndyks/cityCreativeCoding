        <!-- End of intro section -->

        <p>We gave you the opportunity to ask anonymous questions on <a href="https://pollev.com/jsndyks">Poll Everywhere</a>.</p>

        <p>You can add more questions on <a href="https://pollev.com/jsndyks" target="_blank">Poll Everywhere</a> and follow up on any of these answers in the <a href="https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/mod/forum/view.php?f=32433" target="_blank">Discussion Forum</a>.</p>

        <hr/>

        <h5>Once I have collected my data, can I present it on paper or do I have to do it digitally? If so what program shall I use</h5>

        <p>Errr ... we're asking you to use <i>Processing</i> to learn and demonstrate some competency in key concepts and constructs used in computer programming. So use <i>Processing</i> please.<br/>We encourage you to sketch ideas on paper, and you may decide to take photos of some of these and use a <code>PImage</code> to incorporate them into your sketch. Be creative! But use <i>Processing</i>.</p>

        <h5>Can we submit sketches that aren't related to the data collection, alongside the data project? I.e just showing off our skills for fun!</h5>

        <p>We are all for showing off. We love showing off and encourage you all to do so too. 
            We are sure that your personal tutors would like to see your sketches - call in during their office hours and show them what you can do. Blow them away!</p>
        <p>BUT, for this exercise, we will be looking at up to 400 submissions, so we want to make this manageable.
            So please address the criteria (they are pretty straightforward) that we have specified and submit a single sketch.<br/>
            Now, if you have done something fantastic that you want to share (who wouldn't?) we would encourage you to be creative and add some data to it. Make your fantastic show-off sketch a <i>Dear Data</i> sketch and then submit it. We can't wait!
        </p>

        <h5>Does the length of time data has been collected over matter</h5>
        <p>
            No.<br/>
            Giorgia and Stefanie collected on a theme for a week in <i>Dear Data</i>, and you could do the same: or a month or a fortnight or a term or a day. Or you could compare two days or weeks or fortnights (but probably not terms).</p>
        <p>
            The thing that does matter is that you have sufficient data to make your sketch interesting and revealing, and to learn something.  So, if you are collecting for a short period, collect frequently. And in most cases you should collect plenty of data about the characteristics of the phenomenon that is your focus. This will give you a rich and potentially revealing data set. The <a href="https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/mod/page/view.php?id=818121" target="_blank">Data Collection</a> page provides some guidance.
        </p>

        <h5>If we present data in standard forms like in some form of chart or table that would generally be used to store that type of data, would that not be considered "creative"
        </h5>

        <p>Well "creative" is a nuanced concept.<br/>
        But maybe it's worth asking yourself whether what you have done looks original, has original features, required you to do some thinking and problem solving to get it looking like you wanted it to - so that you could express yourself, find you voice.</p>
        <p>If the answers are usually "<i>No</i>" then the answer to your question might be "<i>Yes</i>" - as in, not very creative.</p>
        <p>Try <b><a href="https://www.designorate.com/a-guide-to-the-scamper-technique-for-creative-thinking/" target="_blank">SCAMPER</a></b> or <b>SCAPE</b>!<br/>
        Did you <i>Substitute</i>, <i>Combine</i>., <i>Adapt</i>, <i>Put to Another Use</i>, or <i>Eliminate</i>?<br/>
        If not, then give one or two of those things a try and you may come up with something more original.</p>


        <h5>How would you reference your work without it being on the sketch?<br/>Would you have to make a separate document with all the sources?</h5>

        <p>Make sure they are all listed in the sketch - perhaps use a "Sources" tab with the sources clearly listed in comments.</p>

        <p>You may want to add capability in your sketch that reveals sources when they are used or interacted with.
            The <a href="https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/mod/page/view.php?id=781811" target="_blank">Copyright Discussion & Examples</a> page provides some examples.
        </p>

        <h5>When should we submit our work as there's two dates and also what should we submit specifically for work as I wasn't in for the latest lesson</h5>

        <p>OK - come to lessons, they are great places to learn.</p>
        <p>If you can't make it - use the lecture materials, what you need to do is not very specific, we are leaving lots of this up to you, but it's all documented in <a href="https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/mod/page/view.php?id=829277" target="_blank">Creativity : Core</a>. That's it!</p>
        <p><b>TWO DATES??</b> - really, where?<br/>
        We can only see one date - the Due Date on the <a href="https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/mod/assign/view.php?id=829302" target="_blank">Dear Data Sketch</a> assignment. If you see another one, please raise it on the <a href="https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/mod/forum/view.php?f=32433" target="_blank">Discussion Forum</a> as we will need to fix it.</p>
        <p>In the lecture, Jason gave some good advice: <i>set your own deadline</i>.<br/>
        He suggested that you do this whenever you want to ... but that it must be before the submission area closes on <b>Thursday, 12 December 2024, 6:00 PM</b>.<br/>If you are smart, it will be well before hand.<br/>If you enjoy risks, then leave it until the last minutes, but we advise against this - in our experience this can result in tears and even problems with students failing modules, and failing to progress on their degrees (in credit bearing modules).<br/>Please get used to submitting work well before deadlines.</p>

        <h5>I still don't really understand how do we put the files onto GitHub.
            Do I just copy and paste all the code into a new GitHub folder?</h5>
        <p>
            In a nutshell: yes!<br/>Simply go to your GitHub page and start a new repo from there. Clone the (empty) repo on your computer, and code away. Once happy with your changes/commits, push to the online repo. You will then see on your GitHub page all your code: to submit your work, share the link to this repo on the submission section on Moodle. </p>
        <p>
            Please follow the <a href="https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/mod/page/view.php?id=795676 target="_blank"">"Intro to GitHub" Guide</a> on Moodle on how to create/commit/push if need be.
        </p>


        <h5>Can the GitHub link in the submission be to a personal GitHub or must it be our university account</h5>

        <p>University account only please!</p>


        <h5>What should I do in my spare time at home to become a better coder in java, especially if I've never learnt it before.</h5>

        <p>That's a question for the discussion area in the <i>Java</i> module.</p>
        <p>But, having said that, we are using <i>Processing</i> because it is <i>Java</i> compatible and a great way in to the <i>Java</i> language. Working with classes, objects and methods as well as some of the constructs that we use to store and manipulate them (loops, arrays, array lists, etc.) will set you up nicely for <i>Java</i>.</p>
        <p>So we recommend getting heavily into <code>#CreativeCoding</code> - that's the point really, <i>Processing</i> is a way in to <i>Java</i>, that's why we teach it, that's why we ask you to use it, that's why we put so much effort into the materials and the examples and into trying to give you the space, freedom and permission to experiment with it risk free in ways that are interesting and meaningful to you. We hope.<br/>
        So ... get into and go crazy for <code>#CreativeCoding</code>.
        </p>
        <p> 
           <i>Processing</i> also helps with JavaScript - very useful way to start off.
        </p>

        <p><b>Mai Elshehaly</b> leads the Java module and says ...</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Watch the lecture recordings and flag any bits that are not clear or going too fast.<br/>Bring these to my attention during office hours (Thursdays 3-4pm and Fridays 12-13pm both online and in person)</li>
            <li>Ask lots of questions during lectures and tutorials</li>
            <li>Read the material on Moodle. Highlight bits that you would like to discuss with me and/or tutors</li>
            <li>Stay away from YouTube. It only confuses people at this early stage. We’re here to help and this is a well supported module so my advice for students is to make the most of available resources that City provides. </li>
        </ol>

        <h5>Can we send messages on Moodle until the deadline?</h5>
        <p>Yes!
            <br/>
            Messages that discuss ideas, share perspectives, ask questions, answer questions - the <a href="https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/mod/forum/view.php?f=32433" target="_blank">Discussion Forum</a> is there for all of this, and teaching staff will contribute from time to time up until the deadline.
