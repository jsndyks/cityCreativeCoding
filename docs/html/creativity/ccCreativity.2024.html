            <p>
                It is not a complete record of all that was discussed in a somewhat unstructured lecture in which little new content featured.
                The lecture was a summary, a send-off and an attempt to inspire.

        <p>We have asked you to produce a <i>Dear Data Sketch</i>.</p>
        <p>This should be ...</p>
        <div class="dearData">
            A <i>Processing</i> sketch<br/>
            that depicts a data set that you have collected over time<br/>
            that explores some aspect of the World<br/>
            that is interesting to you<br/>
        </div>

        <p>We hope that you will do this ...</p>
        <div class="dearData">
            in creative &amp; expressive ways <br/>
            that you are pleased with 
        </div>

        <p>And that the process (and perhaps the sketch) ...</p>
        <div class="dearData">
            helps you learn about yourself, data &amp; The World around you. 
        </div>

        <p>Maybe just a little!</p>
        
        <p>Those are the key requirements, it's as simple as that!<br/>But additionally ...<br/>
            We would like the sketch to be  ...</p>
        <div class="dearDataLo" class="lowlight">
            inspired by the <a href="https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/mod/page/view.php?id=791720">Dear Data Project</a>.

            <div class="dearDataLo" class="lowlight">
                <i>Methods</i>, <i>Classes (and Objects)</i>, <i>Interaction</i>, and perhaps <i>Sound and / or Video</i>

        <h3>2. Data Depiction and Generative Design</h3>

        <p>I want to think a little about creativity, generative art and data depiction in today's lecture.</p>
        <p>For now - here is some code to try out:</p>
        <pre class="brush: processing; gutter: false; toolbar: false; highlight:[1,6,12,13]">
            // -- Generative Design Grid
            // -- Generative Art : Line Interference
            
            int lines  = 40;      // &lt;-- number of static lines
            int linesR = 40;      // &lt;-- number of rotated lines
            float yTop, yBot ;
            
            
            void setup () {
            
              size(300, 300);
              translate(width/2, height/2);  // &lt;-- translate origin to centre of canvas
            
              yTop = -height*0.4;  // &lt;-- min y position of lines (after translation)
              yBot =  height*0.4;   // &lt;-- max y position of lines (after translation)
            }
            
            
            void draw () {
            
              background(255);
            
              translate(width/2, height/2);
              
              strokeWeight(map(mouseY, height,0, 12,1));
            
              // -- vertical lines:
              for (int i=0; i&lt;lines; i++) {
                float x = map (i, 0, lines-1, -width*0.4, width*0.4);
                line (x, yTop, x, yBot);
              }
             
              // -- rotated lines :
              rotate(map(mouseX, 0, width, 0, TWO_PI));
            
              for (int i=0; i&lt;linesR; i++) {
                float x = map (i, 0, linesR-1, -width*0.4, width*0.4);
                line (x, yTop, x, yBot);
              }
            }
            
            
            void mouseClicked () {
              // -- change number of lines based upon mouse position:
              lines  = int(map(mouseX, 0,width,  3,100));
              linesR = int(map(mouseY, 0,height, 3,100));
            }
            
            
        </pre>
        <p>And a few pictures - output from the above and interacting with this sketch.</p>
            <figure>

            </figure>
            <p>
                I'd like you to think about the <i>information carrying capacity</i> of these graphics.<br/>
                They all have similar structure, and are generated by the same algorithm.<br/>And yet they vary in many ways, and might vary in others - such as
                where they are positioned, their colour, their size, the line pattern (dashed, dotted, etc.)</p>
            <div class="coreTask">
            <h5>Patterns and Data Depiction</h5>
            <p>If you captured this kind of pattern in a <code>class</code>, how many fields do you think you could add to the class that might then be used for data depiction?</p>

        </div>

        <h3>3. (Dear Data Diary) Design Process ...</h3>

        <p>I want to say something about <i>Design Process</i> and the way that we hope and expect you to use your data and ideas in the <i>Dear Data Sketch</i>.</p>
        <p>Remember that in <i>Dear Data</i>, Giorgia Lupi and Stefanie Posavec see data as an informative inspiring starting point for play and expression that helps us (you) engage with the world ...</p>

            <p>So we want you to be experimental, play with data and your <i>Processing</i> skills and knowledge to experiment.
                Be inspired by what you see in the various examples that you have engaged with, in the module and elsewhere, to try things out.
                Sketch in your <i>Notes &amp; Sketches</i> books, and play with the code to see what happens as you try to depict dat in interesting ways.</p>
            <p>In the <a href="https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/mod/url/view.php?id=836206">Creativity : Lecture</a> I introduce Damien Newman's <i>Design Squiggle</i> in an unmissable segment from <code>13:50 - 16:30</code>. </p>

        <!-- 13:50 - 16:30 https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/mod/url/view.php?id=836206 -->

                <p>This is intended to capture the chaos and refinement of the design process when your ultimate output is unknown - exactly what we are doing here in <i>Dear Data</i> sketching.</p>
                <p>Newman talks about moving from <i>Uncertainty</i> at the start of the process (left) to <i>Clarity &amp; Focus</i> at the end (right), but the path is by no means smooth (squiggle)!</p>
                <p>He uses the terms <i>Abstract</i> -> <i>Concept</i> -> <i>Design</i> to capture the process as we move (chaotically, unexpectedly, non-linearly) from left to right.</p>
                <p>As I consider all of this to be '<i>design</i>' (verb) ... that results in a '<i>design</i>' (noun), I prefer to use the terms <i>Brainstorming</i> -> <i>Refining</i> -> <i>Finishing</i> to describe ways that the design process might follow the squiggle to generate an interesting design.
                And in your <i>Dear Data Sketch</i> you may only get as far as some brainstorming part sketch that is incomplete and best used as the basis for better ideas.That's OK! That's learning!</p>

                <p>You may have noticed above that I used the phrase: <i>when your ultimate output is unknown</i>.<br/>
                This is an important part of this task and the <code>#CreativeCoding</code> activity.
                We said at the outset that we are trying to promote and give you experience of a means of learning and a form of activity that may not be typical of your experience at school. We are not providing model answers. We are presenting the notion that each student has a perfectly viable different good answer that meets the needs of the activity. We know that you are good at producing a solution when given an example and that you have been trained to do this. Here we are giving you material, skills, knowledge, instructions, a vague specification and the space to do something that brings these things together into a unique solution. So, there is no model answer, there are just answers, and many of them.</p>

                <figure>
                    <table style="width: 100%; margin: 0 auto; border-collapse: collapse; text-align: center;">
                        <tr>  
                            <td style="width: 50%; height: 100px;"><img src="./img/cc.modelAnswer.top.jpeg" alt="top" style="width: 100%; height: auto;"></td>
                            <td style="width: 50%; height: 100px;"><img src="./img/cc.modelAnswer.bot.jpeg" alt="top" style="width: 100%; height: auto;"></td>
                        </tr> 
                    </table>
                    <figcaption>
                        Alternative ways of specifying a solution: top down, with a target (left); bottom up, with some guidelines (right).
                    </figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p>These sketches try to show how this works diagrammatically, building a little on <i>The Design Squiggle</i> but moving from bottom to top instead of left to right, and there is a reason for this!</p>
                <p>On the left we see a 'Model Answer' approach. We provide a solution and ask you to achieve it. The boxes at the bottom are students, and what we find, unsurprisingly is that most students converge to the model. We find that this happens even if we have an open task and suggest some solutions. Most students will, perhaps understandably, converge to a piece of work that is very heavily based upon one of the examples.</p>
                <p>On the right we see the 'Idea Specification' approach. This is the one where we tell you what we want (see Section 1 above), equip you with the skills and experience and capability to work on it (see <code>#CreativeCoding</code> activity) and ask you to come up with something that fits. People make progress to wards a unique solution (the top of the page) in a non-linear way and might end up somewhere unexpected. Some people may get a little lost, and the solutions that are produced are varied in terms of complexity, focus, approach, satisfaction, success and pretty much any other criteria we might think of. We end up with a diverse set of outputs. Now this is a module about creativity so we expect you to be creative and help you with some ideas and processes to support this - see the <a href="https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/mod/url/view.php?id=836206">Creativity : Lecture</a> in which I explain and use (re-interpret and modify) the SCAMPER from <code>08:00 - 13:50</code>.</p>
                <p>Now, we understand that this is hard, and risky and there is no guarantee that you will get anywhere at all - which is why <code>#CreativeCoding</code> is voluntary, not graded, bears no credit and as such offers a risk-free space in which to try this approach, an approach in which you produce something original that is specific to you. We think it's important. We are making it safe. While the activity is <i>pointless</i> in terms of grades, we think that it's far from <i>worthless</i> in terms of experience, learning and opportunity. And there are some tangible rewards too: <a href="https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/mod/page/view.php?id=817952">What's the Point?</a></p>

                <p>Or maybe it's not that hard?<br/>
                See (and read and consider and discuss) <a href="https://rl.talis.com/3/city/items/4551ab37-962c-400e-aba3-5053d168fd75.html">Dear Data - To DRAW is to REMEMBER</a>, which is flagged as <i>Essential Reading</i> on the <a href="https://rl.talis.com/3/city/lists/C2D88FE1-918A-7FAF-AB7A-A2E0EC9BB741.html">Reading List</a>.</p>

        <h3>4. Data Dogs</h3>

        <p>Having said all of that we understand the need to demonstrate some of the ways in which the things you are learning can be put together to begin to address the task in hand. One of the important things that we want you to consider is the use of the <code>class</code> capability in <i>Processing</i> to define and instantiate <i>objects</i> that hold and depict data about particular phenomena - the ones that you are recording data about.<br/>
        We provide a simple example of how this might be achieved in the progressively sophisticated <i>Robot</i> classes presented in <a href="https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/mod/page/view.php?id=811315">Objects : Robots</a>.</p>

        <p>Here's another one that you will remember from the <a href="https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/mod/url/view.php?id=836206">Creativity : Lecture</a>.
            I spent 5 minutes (<code>24:54 - 30:00</code>) presenting some code that captures data in a <i>class</i> and uses <i>objects</i> that contain drawing <i>methods</i> to depict data in interesting and original ways. The code is based upon a modification of <a href="https://www.dear-data.com/by-week/#/week-34-a-week-of-urban-wildlife/">Week 34 : A week of urban wildlife</a>: <i>Data Dogs</i>!

            <p>Hopefully this gives you some ideas, you may want to try to get it working, but the main intent here it to show you that we can combine programming concepts and data in ways that are inspired by, but differentiable from, existing efforts, to produce something interesting and original: <i>Combine</i>, <i>Adapt</i>, <i>Substitute</i>.</p>

            <hr class="hrInvisible"/>

        <h3>5. And The Rest ...</h3>

        <p>The rest of the lecture was a bunch of tips and examples, ways to try to inspire you into being expressive and creative in your <code>#CreativeCoding</code> efforts.</p>
        <p>I spoke a little about <i>creativity</i> and encourage you to think outside the box when <code>#CreativeCoding</code>.</p>
        <p>I encouraged you to engage with the law on <i>Copyright</i>, which is discussed in <a href="https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/mod/page/view.php?id=826076">Art : Core</a> document and on a page of <a href="https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/mod/page/view.php?id=781811">Copyright Discussion & Examples</a>.<br/>
        It's pretty simple and following some principles of good practice will keep you safe.</p>
        <p>There were a few tips on engaging with your tutors, and encouragement to submit a <a href="https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/mod/assign/view.php?id=829302">Dear Data Sketch</a>, as described above, so that you qualify to receive:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>a <i>Creative Coding Commentary</i> - from your personal tutor, for use in reference writing and recommendation letters</li>
            <li>a <i>Digital Badge</i> - from the Department of Computer Science, to display on <i>LinkedIn</i> and other social media where you promote your capabilities, competencies and experience</li>
            <li>an invitation to a <i>Pizza & Data party</i> - to celebrate our success and the start of Term 2 when we all arrive back in January (after the exams!)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Please give it a go - be brave, be creative, be engaged and remember that this activity is <a href="https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/mod/page/view.php?id=817952">Pointless but not Worthless</a>.</p>
        <p>I reminded you all to check the <a href="https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/mod/page/view.php?id=818121">Data Collection</a> page for some tips, and not to use <i>Dates</i> or <i>Times</i> in your sketches - just use numbers, with days, minutes, hours or seconds, relative to some starting point.</p>
        <p>There was then some stuff on <i>Dogs</i> and <i>Robots</i> (see above), which was intended to encourage you to use <code>class</code> statements to define <i>classes</i> and create <i>objects</i> that contain and depict your data.<br/>It's conceptually simple, graphically powerful and easy to do the basics.<br/>Then it's just about building!<br/>You have all that you need to do this in the <code>#CreativeCoding</code> notes with <a href="https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/mod/page/view.php?id=806723">Objects : Core</a> being a great place to head to for a reminder and <a href="https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/mod/page/view.php?id=811315">Objects : Robots</a> putting it into practice.</p>
        <p>And then I disappeared for breakfast!<br/>
        It's a long way from Leicester!</p>
        <p>See you on the <a href="https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/mod/forum/index.php?id=15435">Discussion Forum</a>.</p>
