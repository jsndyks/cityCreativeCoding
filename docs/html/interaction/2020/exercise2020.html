            These exercises give you practice with key and mouse input and updating and changing the state of global
            variables and thereby changing the behaviour of the sketch.
        </p>

        <div class="coreTask">
            <h4>1. Traveling square.</h4>
            <p>
                Create a new sketch that draws a square in the centre of a square window sized 400 by 400. Use two
                global variables <code>float x</code> and <code>float y</code> to specify the position of the square:
                <br />
            <pre class="brush: processing; gutter: false; toolbar: false; ">void draw()
{
  rect(x, y, 60, 60);
}</pre>
            <br />
            Remember you have to declare those variables at the top of your sketch and you should initialise them with
            appropriate values inside a void setup() so that your square is positioned correctly when your sketch
            starts.
            <br /><br />
            Run your sketch to check it behaves as expected.
            <br /><br />
            Now add a keyPressed() method to the sketch which maps the 'w' and 's' keys to incrementing and decrementing
            the y position by a value of 1 respectively (think about the coordinate system and how pressing 'w' will
            move the square up) and maps the 'a' and 'd' keys to incrementing and decrementing the x position by a value
            of 1 respectively.
            <br /><br />
            Run your sketch to check you can move the square using the 'A', 'D', 'S' and 'W' keys.
            <br /><br />

            <b>Extension 1a: </b> Add if statements to prevent the values of x and y becoming less than 0 or more than
            400.
            <br /><br />
            <b>Extension 1b: </b> Add if statements to allow the square to go up to but not past the bounds of the
            sketch.
            <br /><br />
            <b>Extension 2:</b> Add code to the <code>draw()</code> method that displays the x and y position of the
            rectangle in the bottom corner of the sketch. The text should update when the position of the rectangle is
            changed.
            </p>

            <h4>2. Fade to Red.</h4>
            <p>
                Add a <code>void setup()</code> method with code to set the size of the sketch to 400 by 400.
                <br /><br />
                Initialise the red variable to 0.
                <br /><br />
                Add a <code>void draw()</code> method that contains the following code:
                <br />
            <pre class="brush: processing; gutter: false; toolbar: false; ">void draw()
{
  background(100);
  fill(red, 0, 0);
  rect(100, 100, 60, 60);
}</pre>
            <br />
            Use Processing's <code>void keyPressed()</code> method to increment the value of red by 10 for every press
            of
            the 'r' key. Decrement the value or red by 10 for every press of the 'b' key.
            <br /><br />
            <b>Extension:</b> Add if statements to prevent the value of red becoming less than 0 or more than 255.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="coreTask">
            <h4>3. Password Reader.</h4>
            <p>
                The following code displays a password request message to the user. Copy the code to your own sketch and
                make sure it runs.
                <br />
            <pre class="brush: processing; gutter: false; toolbar: false; ">
String welcomeMessage = "Type the password...";
String successMessage = "Welcome. Shall we play a game?";
String retryMessage = "Your password is incorrect. No Global Thermonuclear War for you. Please try again";
String currentMessage;

void setup()
{
  size(300, 50);
  textSize(16);
  currentMessage = welcomeMessage;
}

void draw()
{
  background(100);
  text(currentMessage, 20, 20);
}</pre>
            Once you have the sketch running use Processing's <code>keyPressed()</code> method to display the success
            message if the key pressed matches a password, for example, you could choose the password 'p' and display
            the success message if the key pressed is 'p' and the retry message if not.
            </p>

            <h4>Extension</h4>

            <p>
                Add support for passwords longer than one letter. Currently your code checks the global variable key
                against a single character (e.g. 'p'). To compare strings of characters you need to put each
                consecutive key press into a String type variable. The code <code>userString = userString + key;</code>
                will be useful.
                <br /><br />
                There are other differences between Strings and characters too. Literal strings that you write in your
                code have double quotes e.g. in the code below the variable password is set to contain the string
                literal "swordfish" and the variable userString is set to being an empty string (a string with no
                letters), which in turn is different to an uninitialized string like blankVariable (which prints out
                null if you print it).
                <br />

            <pre class="brush: processing; gutter: false; toolbar: false; ">String password = "swordfish"; // A variable containing a string
String userString = "";        // A variable containing an empty string
String blankVariable;           // A variable containing nothing at all (null).</pre>
            <br />
            Checking whether two Strings are equal is different to checking whether two characters are equals. Use
            the following code to check if two Strings are the same: <code>password.equals(userString)</code>
            <br /><br />
            The above expression will either return true if the Strings are the same or false otherwise and can be
            used as the condition of an if statement.
            <br /><br />
            <pre class="brush: processing; gutter: false; toolbar: false; ">if ( password.equals(userString) )
{
  println("match!");
}</pre>
            <br />
            Note the dot (.) between password and equals. This is how methods are called on objects, more on this in
            the session on 'classes'
            <br /><br />
            The completed version of this will return the retry method for each character you press until you have
            typed the whole password. If you make a mistake you will need to restart the program as the code treats
            backspace like any other character. Look at the final challenge for some clues about how to improve this
            behaviour.

            <h4>4. Target Hunter.</h4>

            <p>
                Write code so that a white target circle is drawn randomly on the screen. Each time you click it, the
                circle is redrawn at a random position within the sketch and at a random size.
                <br /><br />
                Before you start writing code consider the global variables and the functions you will need to implement
                the behaviour of your sketch. A sensible approach would be break the behaviour of the sketch down into
                smaller testable goals, for example:
            <ul>
                <li>Make a list of global variables and discuss it with one of the lab staff.</li>
                <li>Draw a centred circle and test.</li>
                <li>Add the click detection and test.</li>
                <li>Update the circle position</li>
                <li>Update the circle size.</li>
            </ul>

            <i>Hints:</i>
            <ul>
                <li>To detect whether the click is within the circle you can use Processing's <a
                        href="https://processing.org/reference/dist_.html" target="_blank">dist()</a> method.</li>
                <li>To test for the click detection consider printing "Hit" to the console.</li>
                <li>To set the position of the circle to a random position you can use Processing's <a
                        href="https://processing.org/reference/random_.html" target="_blank">random()</a> method.</li>
                <li>Make sure you constrain the positions so the circle stays within the sketch.</li>
            </ul>

            </p>
        </div>
        <br /><br />

        <div class="challenge">
            <h4>5. Password Reader (advanced).</h4>
            <p>
                Open your PasswordReader sketch and add the following behaviour:
            <ul>
                <li>Enter/Return - check the password only when the either the enter or return key is pressed.</li>
                <li>Backspace - if the user presses backspace the last key added to the userString should be removed.
                </li>
            </ul>
            Before you start coding discuss the logic (what you program checks for in its if statements and what order
            this should be done int) with one of the lab staff. Testing for the enter, return and backspace keys is
            documented in the <a href="https://processing.org/reference/keyCode.html" target="_blank">keyCode</a>
            documentation, so read this to figure out how to test for one of these keys being pressed.
            <br /><br />
            Removing the last letter of a string requires the use of a method (like <code>.equals()</code> method we saw
            earlier for testing string equality). The following example replaces <code>userString</code> with a copy of
            it with the final character removed. BUT BE CAREFUL - if the string is empty (or null) the program will
            crash so check for these conditions before using the code.
            <br /><br />
            <pre
                class="brush: processing; gutter: false; toolbar: false; ">userString = userString.substring(0, userString.length()-1);</pre>
            You may find that you need to use:
            <br /><br />
            <pre
                class="brush: processing; gutter: false; toolbar: false; ">userString = userString.substring(0, userString.length()-2);</pre>
            because the backspace character might be added to the <code>userString</code>, so if you only trim off 1
            character you wind up adding and then immediately removing the backspace key. This depends on how you catch
            the key values.
            </p>
        </div>

        <!-- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ -->

        <div class="challenge">
            <h4>6. Hangman.</h4>
            <p>
                Hangman is a paper and pencil guessing game for two or more players. One player thinks of a word, phrase
                or sentence and the other(s) tries to guess it by suggesting letters or numbers, within a certain number
                of guesses.
                <br /><br />
                Implement a computer version of the game that presents blank spaces representing the number of
                characters in the word the player is trying to guess. For each incorrectly guessed letter, the computer
                should store and display the letter (so the user does not suggest it again). Additionally when a letter
                is guessed incorrectly the computer should draw the next element of the hangman:
                <br /><br />
                The hangman is drawn in the following sequence:
            <ol>
                <li>Base of gibbet</li>
                <li>Upright of gibbet</li>
                <li>Crosspiece of gibbet</li>
                <li>Noose and head</li>
                <li>Body</li>
                <li>Left arm</li>
                <li>Right arm</li>
                <li>Left leg</li>
                <li>Right leg</li>
            </ol>
            This gives the player 9 guesses before the hanged man is complete and the game is lost. If the word is
            complete before the hangman then the player has won. In either case you should display an appropriate
            message to the player and then either start a new game with the next word or terminate the program.
            <br /><br />
            The following is a list of words you can use.
            <br /><br />
            <pre class="brush: processing; gutter: false; toolbar: false; ">String word1 = "saxophone";
String word2 = "trombone";
String word3 = "harpsichord";
String word4 = "glockenspiel";
String word5 = "harmonica";</pre>

            <h4>7. Naughts and Crosses.</h4>
            <p>
                Naughts and crosses (also known as tic-tac-toe or Xs and Os) is a paper and pencil game for two players,
                X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3×3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of
                their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.
                <br /><br />
                Implement a computer version of the game that presents a sketch divided in to a 3x3 grid. The player
                should be able to click on any of the squares in the grid and the screen should update with an X in that
                square. The computer should randomly select another, empty square in the grid and should update the
                screen to display an O in that square.
                <br /><br />
                Play should continue until all squares in the grid are filled or the player or computer has won. Winning
                the game consists of either player achieving a row, column or diagonal run of 3 of their symbols.
                <br /><br />
                You will need to create 9 variables representing the squares of the grid, code that implements random
                responses of the computer, code to test for the possible win conditions and code that tests for the end
                of the game. The game will need to respond to mouse clicks within set areas of the sketch and will need
                to draw gridlines and symbols.
