                <h3>1. Interaction</h3>
                <p class="focusOFF">&gt;&gt;1</p>
                <p> We've looked at how to <a href="https://moodle.city.ac.uk/mod/page/view.php?id=2058681">code programs that adapt to context</a> with constructs that allow us to write code that makes choices as it executes.<br/>
                  <br/>But how do we code programs that adapt to people?<br/>

                    A computer isn't much good without <b>interaction</b>!<br/>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Luckily (<i>actually, there is careful planning and sophisticated functionality involved</i>) <i>Processing</i>
                    has rich and straightforward capabilities for detecting input from mouse, keyboard and elsewhere and
                    for using this to allow us to interact rapidly and consistently with sketches.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And we're going to play with the basics today.
                </p>
                <p>
                    First up ... let's think about how we interact with computers:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>we talk to them</li>
                    <li>we drag mice and trackpads</li>
                    <li>we swipe and touch and tilt them</li>
                    <li>we tap on keyboards and wrestle with game controllers</li>
                    <li>anything else?</li>
                </ul>
                <div class="coreTask">
                    <b>Interacting with Computers</b>
                    <p>Is that it?<br />Can you think of other ways you interact with computers?<br />You should be able
                        to come up with at least a few. <br /> Chat with a friend if you're stuck.<br />A chat can usually get you thinking and discussing things with them will often help
                        out.</p>
                    <!-- guitar, bike -->
                </div>
                <p>Interaction is how we get computers to do things that are useful to us, and how they know what we're
                    up to and what we want.</p>
                <p>So, if we're going to make interesting applications we need to know how to collect information about
                    interactions, how to detect what people doing are make our programs and sketches respond.</p>
                <p>Let's start with the keyboard - a handy device that you may have used from time to time - that
                    enables us to select from a series of letters, that are detected by the computer and used as input
                    to various programmes and apps that it runs!</p>

                <hr />
                <h3>2. Keyboard Input</h3>
                <p>
                    Happily, <i>Processing</i> sketches are aware of what's going on with the keyboard.
                    You can find this out and use this in your sketches in a couple of ways.
                    Firstly, <i>Processing</i> retains a global variable (like <code>mouseX</code> and
                    <code>mouseY</code>) called <a href="https://processing.org/reference/key.html"
                        target="_blank">key</a>.
                    This is a <i>character</i> variable holds the value of the most recently pressed key on the
                    keyboard.
                    Useful!
                </p>

                <h4>Key Sketch</h4>
                <p class="focusOFF">&gt;&gt;2</p>
                <p>
                    Here's a sketch that takes advantage of the way that <code>key</code> is updated from the keyboard
                    to show interactions made through the keyboard on the canvas.
                </p>
                <pre class="brush: processing; gutter: false; toolbar: false; ">// -- set up the things that don't change ...
void setup() {
  size(400, 400);
  textSize(128);      // &lt;-- try changing this
  textAlign(CENTER); // &lt;-- centers text!
}

// -- do these things 60 times per second ...
void draw() {

  // -- clear the canvas:
  background(220);              // &lt;-- try a different colour

  // -- show the value of the key variable in the middle of the canvas:
  text(key,width/2,height/2); // &lt;-- try a different position
}</pre>

                  <b>Keyboard Interaction - key variable</b>
                    <p>Read through the code above to see if you can work out what it does.</p>
                    <p>Then run the sketch on the right - click it and press some keys and see how the value of
                        <code>key</code> changes.
                    </p>
                    <p>Then copy the above code in <i>Processing</i> and see what happens!</p>
                    <p>Make a few changes as suggested in the comments and check that they have the effects that you
                        expect:</p>
                        <ul>
                          <li>change text size</li>
                          <li>change colour</li>
                          <li>change text position</li>
                        </ul>

                <p>There you go - <b>interaction</b>!</p>
                <p>But of course we can do more, and <i>Processing</i> has some useful features that help with this.</p>

                <h4>KeyPressed Sketch</h4>
                <p class="focusOFF">&gt;&gt;3</p>
                <p>
                    One of the most useful functions for interaction is the <a
                        href="https://processing.org/reference/keyPressed_.html"><code>keyPressed</code></a> method.</p>
                <p>This is called by a <i>Processing</i> sketch every time a key is pressed.
                </p>
                <p>You simply create a new method called <code>keyPressed()</code> as shown below, and <i>Processing</i>
                    will call this method every time it detects a <i>key press</i> interaction. Let's try it!</p>

            <div class="unit-30 annotation">

}

// -- Processing calls this method whenever a key is pressed:

                  <b>Keyboard Interaction - keyPressed() method</b>
                    <p>Read through the code again and see if you can work what's new.
                      <br/>What happens in
                        <code>keyPressed()</code>?
                    </p>
                    <p>Then run the sketch on the right - click it and press some keys and see how the value of
                        <code>key</code> changes.
                    </p>
                    <p>Then copy the above code in <i>Processing</i> and make sure it runs as expected!</p>
                    <p>As usual, you should make a few changes and check that they have the effects that you expect.</p>
                    <p>If they don't - discuss!</p>
                </div>


                <h4>Ordered Characters Sketch</h4>

                <p>This is pretty, but we might want to do something a bit more structured with the input, like arrange
                    it in a way that shows sequence.</p>
                <img src="https://jsndyks.github.io/cityBootCamp/images/interaction/orderedCharacters.png" />
                <p>
                    To do this we'll need to store information about where we put each piece of <code>text()</code> that
                    we generate in response to a key press being detected in <code>keyPressed()</code>.
                    <br />
                    Hopefully you'll be thinking <i>global variables</i> as you are reading this?
                </p>
                <p>We'll use a <i>global variable</i> called <b>p</b> to store this positional information and increment
                    it by a few pixels each time a key is pressed - in the <code>keyPressed()</code> method.</p>
                <p>This is fine while <b>p</b> is less than <b>width</b>.
                    But our letters will plot off the right hand side of the canvas as we type more keys unless we do
                    something about this!</p>
                <p>A little bit of simple maths will work out where we put each successive value of <b>key</b> to the
                    right of the next ... until we get to the end of the screen canvas, at which point we need to head
                    back to the left and down a line.</p>
                <p>It's pretty straightforward ...</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><code>p%width</code> - uses the <a href="https://processing.org/reference/modulo.html">modulo
                            operator</a> <code>%</code>.<br />
                        This calculates the <i>remainder when one number is divided by another</i>. So 110%100 is 10. As
                        is 210%100.
                        This is handy as any number <code>%width</code> gives us a position between 0 and width. When we
                        get a number that is just more than width, this gives us a position back on the left hand side
                        of the canvas as <code>(width+1)%width</code> is 1! </li>
                    <li><code>24*int(p/width)</code> - <a
                            href="https://processing.org/reference/divide.html">divide</a>s <b>p</b> by <b>width</b>. It
                        also uses the <code><a href="https://processing.org/reference/intconvert_.html">int()</a></code>
                        operator to convert the result to an integer. This means that we get a whole number - the number
                        of times <b>width</b> completely fits into <b>p</b>. So <code>int((width+1)/width)</code> is 1!
                        and <code>int((5*width+1)/width)</code> is 5.
                        It follows that int(110/100) is 1. And int(210/100) is 2.
                        If you think about it, this means we find out how may times <b>p</b> has filled our <b>width</b>
                        through this part of the calculation. Which tells us how many <i>lines</i> of length
                        <b>width</b> the characters have taken up. If we then multiply through by a number that is
                        bigger than our current letter height, like <b>24</b> or something, this will position text that
                        has an <b>p</b> value that is greater than <b>width</b> down the screen so that it does not
                        overlap. I have added another <b>100</b> on so that the text does not start at the very top of
                        the screen!
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Here's some code that should do the job!</p>
                <pre class="brush: processing; gutter: false; toolbar: false; ">
// -- global variable - used to count keypresses and position text
int p = 0;

void setup() {
  size(400, 400);
  background(220);
  textSize(18);
  fill(64);
}

// -- do nothing in the draw loop for now!
void draw() {}

void keyPressed() {
  p+=12; // -- add 12 to p each time

  // -- put the char held in 'key' at a screen position
  // --   that increases in x and y with each key press
  text(key,p%width, 100 + 24*int(p/width));

  // -- the above just calculates a position for the text as p increases
  // -- use println() to print out the values to the console if you like
  // -- remove '/width' and see what happens as you get to the right hand side!
}</pre>

                  <b>Keyboard Interaction - adding some order</b>
                    <p>Check the code and comments, and look at the way the position of the text varies according to the
                        global variable <b>p</b>.</p>
                    <p>Then run the sketch on the right - see what happens as you press more keys and get to the end of
                        the canvas!</p>
                    <p>Make the changes suggested in the comments to make sure that you understand what's going on.</p>
                    <p>What will happen if you make the number <b>24</b> bigger or smaller? Try it!<br />Were you

                <h4>KeyPressed Sketch with Control Flow</h4>
                <p>This is a good start, but we are likely want to <i>control program flow</i> from the keyboard.</p>
                <p>With any luck, you'll be thinking about <code>if</code> statements already, and how we might add them
                    into <code>keyPressed()</code> to respond to interaction from the keyboard.</p>
                <p>Here's how we might use one in <code>keyPressed()</code> to do things in a sketch depending upon
                    keyboard input - to clear the screen in this case.</p>

                <pre class="brush: processing; gutter: false; toolbar: false; ">
  void keyPressed() {
    // -- change program flow depending on value of key:
    if (key == ' ') {  // &lt;-- try changing the key that is pressed to clear
      background(240); // &lt;-- try changing the background colour used
    } else {
      p+=12; // -- add 12 to p each time &lt;-- try changing this to p-=4

      // -- put the char held in 'key' at a screen position
      // --   that increases in x and y with each key press
      text(key, p%width, 100 + 24*int(p/width));
    }
  }
</pre>

                <p>This code says ...</p>
                <blockquote>When a key is pressed, if the key is 'space', then fill the canvas with a light
                    grey,<br />otherwise add 12 to p and then put the value of key on the canvas at a position depending
                    on the value of p.</blockquote>
                <p>It's useful to be able to express your code like this - do practice!</p>

                <h4>ColourKey Sketch</h4>
                <p>So far, our interaction has resulted in a <i>truly terrible</i> world processing package. Shocking.
                    Awful. Sorry about that!</p>
                <p>But we have been messing about like this to make sure you understand how to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Relate a key press to the <code>key</code> variable</li>
                    <li>Check which key has been pressed</li>
                    <li>See how we can detect and act on a key press with <code>keyPressed()</code></li>
                    <li>Combine interactions with stuff you have learned before to do useful things - controlling the
                        flow in your sketch</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Hopefully you understand all of this and can do some of it, which makes it all worth it.</p>
                <p>However, it's <b>very important</b> that you don't get mixed up and think that <code>key</code> and
                    <code>keyPressed()</code> only enable us to do things with text. That's not the case - we can do
                    much more interesting things by responding to interaction through the keyboard.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can use the <code>keyPressed()</code> method to modify the contents of variables in your sketch
                    that do all sorts of things.
                    By combining void <code>keyPressed()</code> with the conditional code from the previous session, and
                    as we have seen above, you can modify any type of variable depending on the value of the input.
                </p>

                <p class="focusOFF">&gt;&gt;4</p>
                <p>
                    In the sketch below, a rectangle is drawn using the the <a
                        href="https://processing.org/reference/rect_.html" target="_blank">rect()</a> method. The
                    rectangle is filled with colour (by a call to <a href="https://processing.org/reference/fill_.html"
                        target="_blank">fill</a>) using a global variables called <code>r</code>, <code>g</code> and
                    <code>b</code> (representing the red, green and blue components of colour).
                    Initially, amount of red in the fill is 0 out of 255, the amount of green in the is 0 out of 255 and
                    likewise the amount of blue in the fill is 0 out of 255 so the overall colour given by
                    <code>fill(r, g, b)</code> is made of no red, no green and no blue. That's deep dark nightly
                    <b>black</b>.
                </p>
                <pre class="brush: processing; gutter: false; toolbar: false; ">int r, g, b;

void setup() {
  size(200, 200);
  r = 0;
  g = 0;
  b = 0;
}

void draw() {
  background(254, 232, 134);
  fill(r, g, b);
  rect(50, 50, 100, 100);
}</pre>

                <p>But we can do something about this!<br />We can make our sombre rectangle 🙁 much more cheery 😁 with
                    some keyboard interaction.</p>

                <h3>3. What About the Mouse?</h3>
                <p>
                    So, we have a useful series of variables and methods to enable us to interact with and through the
                    keyboard.
                    But that only gets us so far - we can only specify a limited set of things as defined by the keys.
                    What if we want to identify locations on the screen. Quickly. With precision?<br />
                    I think you know where this is going, right?<br />
                </p>

                <img src="https://jsndyks.github.io/cityBootCamp/images/interaction/stuMouse.png" />

                <p>Well, in the 1970s researchers at the Xerox Research Centre in Palo Alto, California were asking
                    themselves the same question:</p>
                <blockquote>What if we want to identify locations on the screen?<br />Quickly. With precision?<br />How
                    do we do that?</blockquote>
                <p>So they invented the mouse!</p>

                <p>It's hard to imagine just how innovative this mode of interaction was back then, and the kind of
                    computing and interaction is has enabled.</p>
                <p>One of these innovators was <b><a href="https://dl.acm.org/profile/81406592524">Stuart K.
                            Card</a></b>, who worked in and subsequently led a hugely creative and productive team at
                    Xerox PARC from the mid 1970s until 2010.
                    One of the many things that he and his colleagues were thinking about back then (probably more
                    deeply than we just did) was how to get computers to know what we need of them.
                    They wanted to come up with devices that were easy to use and provided efficient and precise
                    interactions.
                </p>
                <p>In their mouse prototypes, wheels and rollers generated electronic signals (and squeaked a bit
                    sometimes), that reliably allowed a computer user to specify positions on a desk, that could in turn
                    be converted into positions on a screen.
                    This gives us an effective flexible and efficient new means of interacting with computers.</p>
                <p>Here are some prototypes, taken from a nice article and interview on <a

                    too, which was full of wisdom.<br />It wasn't about 🐁 at all.<br />It was about 🐢s and

                <p>Nowadays, we have <i>trackpads</i> and <i>touch</i> and all sorts of other ways of identifying
                    coordinates and parts of the screen as we interact with computers. But most of these derive fom
                    ideas first captured in the mouse.</p>
                <p>Most mouse actions are about identifying areas of the screen, and <i>Processing</i> has some
                    excellent features for capturing where on the screen we are focusing as we use a mouse or similar
                    device.</p>
                    <p class="focusOFF">&gt;&gt;6</p>
                <p>These methods and variables are in some ways similar to those used with the keyboard. Let's start
                    with a summary table.</p>

                </table>

                <p>You already know the global variables <code>mouseX</code> and <code>mouseY</code>.
                    These tell you something about how your sketch is being interacted with.</p>
                <p>Then we get to the <i>methods</i>, which are called whenever we <i>click</i>, <i>press</i>,
                    <i>release</i>, <i>move</i> or <i>drag</i> the mouse. Or whatever peripheral we are using to control
                    <i>where</i> on the screen we want to focus.
                </p>
                <p class="focusOFF">&gt;&gt;7</p>
                <p>
                    <i>Processing</i> supplies special methods for all of these events.
                    For example, <a href="https://processing.org/reference/mouseClicked_.html"
                        target="_blank">mouseClicked()</a>. <i>Processing</i> automatically detects a click of the mouse
                    and calls this method whenever that happens.
                    So, if the mouse is clicked in a sketch, <i>Processing</i> looks for a method called <a
                        href="https://processing.org/reference/mouseClicked_.html" target="_blank">mouseClicked()</a>,
                    and if it finds one in the sketch, it runs it.
                    Code in this method can do anything - <code>println()</code>, <code>background(255,0,0)</code>,
                    whatever. You decide what happens. Try these ideas! And others!
                </p>

                <h3>4. Interaction and State?</h3>

                <p>You should by now have your sketches working in all sorts of ways based upon your keyboard and mouse
                    interactions. That's great.</p>

                    <p class="focusOFF">&gt;&gt;8</p>
                    <p>But in explaining how to do things we have led you into <b>bad habits</b>.
                    That's not so great! So let's unpick things a little.
                </p>

                <h4>Detecting, Recording and Doing - How to Structure a Sketch for Interaction</h4>

                <p>The key thing is that empty <code>draw()</code> loop!</p>
                <p>The <code>draw()</code> loop is the place to draw and do things.<br />
                    These event handling methods are not.<br />
                    They are best for changing and recording <i>system state</i> - the way the sketch is
                    configured.<br />
                    The <code>draw()</code> loop is then the place to act on that state.</p>
                <p>In summary ...</p>
                <pre class="brush: processing; gutter: false; toolbar: false; ">
// -- THE MAIN DRAW LOOP!

void draw() {
  // -- Do things in here
  // --   based upon variables set in the event handling methods.
}

// -- THE EVENT HANDLING METHODS!

void keyPressed() {
  // -- Set variables here that describe the state of your sketch
  // --   based upon interactions and input.
  // -- These will be acted on in the draw() loop.
}

void mouseClicked() {
  // -- Set variables here that describe the state of your sketch
  // --   based upon interactions and input.
  // -- These will be acted on in the draw() loop.
}</pre>
                <p>So ... even more bluntly ... <b>Don't draw things in the event handling methods!</b>.</p>
                <p>Here is a refactoring of the <code>keyPressed</code> sketches that structures things as we advise
                    above.</p>
                <p>It's a little longer than the other examples, but should be readable. Take your time.</p>

            <div class="unit-30 annotation">

// -- SET UP : initialise and do things that don't change :
void setup() {
  size(400, 400);
  background(220);
  textSize(18);
}

// -- ACT : do things in here (like draw) based upon system state!
void draw() {

  // -- check whether to make text red:
  if (isRed) {
    // -- set fill to red:
    fill(255, 0, 0);
    isRed = false;
  } else {
    fill(64);
  }

  // -- check whether to add text:
  if (addText) {
    // -- add text at the mouse position:
    text(key, mouseX, mouseY);
    addText = false;
  }

  // -- check whether to clear screen:
  if (clearScreen) {
    // -- clear the screen: random light grey!
    background(int(random(180, 240)));
    // -- reset system state:
    clearScreen = false;
  }
}

// -- INTERACT : detect things in these event handling methods
// --   that establish and record system state:
void keyPressed() {
  // -- set variable to record current state:
  addText = true;

  // -- set variable to record current state:
  if (key == 'r' || key =='R') {
    isRed = true;
  }
}

void mouseClicked() {
  // -- set variable to record current state:
  clearScreen = true;
}</pre>

                <p>One of the reasons we didn't organise the other examples in this way was to keep them short and sweet
                    as we introduced concepts.</p>
                <p>But we need you to understand how to ...</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>detect and capture interaction</li>
                    <li>use it to set variables that describe the state of your system (sketch)</li>
                    <li>check these in the <code>draw()</code> loop to control flow based upon inputs acquired through
                        interaction</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This gives you plenty of scope for producing exciting, imaginative, quick, interactive sketches.</p>
                <p>So let's try to add something to this skeleton sketch!</p>

                <p>These little examples are intended to show you what is possible, and we haven't really worked with
                    examples where interactions persist and accumulate. Also let's try an example that will challenge
                    you a little an help you see how this can be achieved.</p>
                <p>We're going to count the number of times a sketch is clicked. Remember that
                    <code>mouseClicked()</code> is called, if you have defined it, every time that happens. This is a
                    great start!

                        mouse is clicked.<br />
                        This variable records the number of times the canvas has been clicked in your sketch.</p>
                        <p>You'll need to increment <code>clickCound</code> in a <code>mouseClicked()</code> method.</p>

                        Modify your code to add and display a second variable <code>randomNum</code>, that contains a
                        different random value between 0 and 99 each time the mouse is clicked.
                    </p>

                        numbers generated during the various clicks.<br />
                        It should be apparent that <code>runningTotal/clickCount</code> will give you the average.<br />
                        But watch out - dividing any number by zero results in an error, so you will need a condition to
                        make sure that you only calculate the average <code>if (clickCount &gt;0)</code>.

                <h4>Hang on, that's not an interface!</h4>
                <p>You are now equipped with many ways of interacting with sketches and should be able to produce
                    wonderfully interactive work. All it requires is a bit of practice and a lot of imagination.</p>
                    <p class="focusOFF">&gt;&gt;10</p>
                <p>We have deliberately <b>not</b> focussed on some of the standard windows style interface elements

                    interesting, innovative and inspiring interactions!<br />But maybe we should show you how you can
                    use what you know to make them!</p>
                <p>Here's a basic example:</p>

  x = width/4;
  y = height/4;
  size = width/15;
}

// -- The draw() loop - here is where we control flow and draw things!

    // -- yellow if on!
    background(255, 255, 140);
  } else {
    // -- white if not!
    background(255);
  }

  // -- change colour to be used in rect based on status:
  if (isIn) {

  } else {

  // -- the main rectangle - always shown :
  rect(x, y, size, size);

  fill(64, 200);
  // -- things to show based on status!
  if (isOn) {
    // -- middle rectangle and reminder text :
    rect(x+size*0.25, y+size*0.25, size*0.5, size*0.5);
    text("Remember to turn me off before you leave ...", 120, height-10);
    text("On", x+size*1.5, 15+height/4);
  } else {
    text("Off", x+size*1.5, 15+height/4);
  }
}

                <p>The key thing to see here is the way that we check whether the mouse is in the rectangle or not with
                    some basic comparisons of the mouse position with the extent of the rectangle.</p>

                        Can you edit the code so that you are <i>in</i> the rectangle, so what it responds as though you

                To make good use of a homegrown button like this, we often use our own 'methods' - collections of <i>Processing</i> code and capability that allow us to define and call on functionality whenever we need it - like when a button is pressed.
                We will cover methods in the next session.
