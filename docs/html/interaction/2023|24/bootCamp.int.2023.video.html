    <p><b style="color:#bb6666">There is no face-to-face lecture for this session.</b><br/>
    <b style="color:#bb6666">So please watch this video introduction before the practical class instead.</b><br/>
    I recorded the lecture in October 2022, but having watched through I think it's pretty good and so even though Moodle looks a little different now and I look a little younger, I'd like to invoke the 2022 me for your 2023 introduction to interaction!<br/>
    During your course in Computer Science we will teach you the importance of <i>re-use</i> and in the spirit of <i>re-use</i>, well, here I am looking sprightly in 2022.</p> 
    <p>If you watch the video you will know the key (literally) variables and methods that are used for interaction, and have seen them used in simple sketches, before you start trying things out for yourself in the classes at 3pm as you work through the lecture materials.</p>
    <p><b style="color:#bb6666">At 3pm, head to your scheduled class as shown on the <a href="https://mytimetable.city.ac.uk/">BootCamp Timetable</a></b> and work through the <a href="https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/mod/page/view.php?id=420874">Interaction Lecture</a>.</p>
