        <p> Work through these notes and examples <i>systematically</i> in class.
            You'll need to do some reading, some thinking and experiment a little. 
            You'll need to discuss your progress and your approaches (and your failures) with colleagues and teaching staff.
            Use your sketchbooks to develop ideas and take notes.
            Learning actively, taking notes and discussing ideas will enable you to achieve the learning outcomes that we list at the top of the lecture.</p>

                <h3>1. Interaction</h3>
                <p class="focusON"><code><span class="focusHash">#</span><span class="focusNum">1</span> - <b>Interaction</b> : how do we interact with computers?</code></p>
                <p> We've looked at how to <a href="https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/mod/page/view.php?id=420864">code programs that adapt to context</a> with constructs that allow us to write code that makes choices as it executes: <a href="https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=6081#section-5">DECISIONS</a><br/>
                  <br/>But how do we code programs that adapt to people?<br/>

                    A computer isn't much use without us being able to tell it what to do - without <b>interaction</b>!<br/>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Luckily (<i>actually, there is careful planning and sophisticated functionality involved</i>) <i>Processing</i>
                    has rich and straightforward capabilities for detecting input from mouse, keyboard and elsewhere and
                    for using this to allow us to interact rapidly and consistently with sketches.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And you're seen a few of these already, and we're going to play with them and a few other basics today.
                </p>
                <p>
                    First up ... let's think about how we interact with computers:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>we talk to them</li>
                    <li>we drag mice and trackpads</li>
                    <li>we swipe and touch and tilt them</li>
                    <li>we tap on keyboards and wrestle with game controllers</li>
                    <li>anything else?</li>
                </ul>
                <div class="coreTask">
                    <b>Interacting with Computers</b>
                    <p>Is that it?<br />Can you think of other ways you interact with computers?<br />You should be able
                        to come up with at least a few. <br /> Chat with a friend if you're stuck.<br />A chat can usually get you thinking and discussing things with them and will often help out.</p>
                    <!-- guitar, bike -->
                </div>
                <p>Interaction is how we get computers to do things that are useful to us, and how they know what we're
                    up to and what we want.</p>
                <p>So, if we're going to make interesting applications we need to know how to collect information about
                    interactions, how to detect what people are doing, and how to make our programs and sketches respond.</p>
                <p>Let's start with the keyboard - a handy device that you may have used from time to time - that
                    enables us to select from a series of letters, that are detected by the computer and used as input
                    to various programmes and apps that it runs!</p>

                <hr />
                <h3>2. Keyboard Input</h3>
                <p>
                    Happily, <i>Processing</i> sketches are aware of what's going on with the keyboard.
                    You can find this out and use this in your sketches in a couple of ways.
                    Firstly, <i>Processing</i> retains a global variable (like <code>mouseX</code> and
                    <code>mouseY</code>) called <a href="https://processing.org/reference/key.html"
                        target="_blank"><code>key</code></a>.
                    This is a <i>character</i> variable that holds the value of the most recently pressed key on the
                    keyboard.
                    It updates whenever a key on the keyboard is pressed - you don't have to ask it to do so, <i>Processing</i> just takes care of it while any sketch runs. It has been there the whole time!
                    Useful!
                </p>
                <img src="https://jsndyks.github.io/cityCreativeCoding/images/interaction/keyboard.png" />

                <h4>Key Sketch</h4>
                <p class="focusON"><code><span class="focusHash">#</span><span class="focusNum">2</span> - <b>key</b> : a variable that contains the last key pressed</code></p>
                <p>
                    Here's a sketch that takes advantage of the way that <code>key</code> is updated from the keyboard.
                    It shows any interactions made through the keyboard on the canvas.
                </p>

    void setup() {
    size(400, 400);
    textSize(128);      // &lt;-- try changing this
    textAlign(CENTER); // &lt;-- centers text!
    }

    // -- do these things 60 times per second ...
    void draw() {

    // -- clear the canvas:
    background(220);              // &lt;-- try a different colour

    // -- show the value of the key variable in the middle of the canvas:
    text(key,width/2,height/2); // &lt;-- try a different position
    }

                    <p>Then run the sketch on the right 👉.<br/>
                        Click it and press some keys and see how the value of <code>key</code> changes.
                    </p>
                    <p>Then copy the above code in <i>Processing</i> and see what happens!</p>
                    <p>Make a few changes as suggested in the '<code>try</code>' comments and check that they have the effects that you expect:</p>
                        <ul>
                          <li>change text size</li>
                          <li>change colour</li>
                          <li>change text position</li>
                        </ul>
                </div>

                <p>There you go - <b>interaction</b>!</p>
                <p>But of course we can do more, and <i>Processing</i> has some useful features that help with this.</p>

                <p class="focusON"><code><span class="focusHash">#</span><span class="focusNum">3</span> - <b>keyPressed()</b> : a method that runs when a key is pressed</code></p>
                <p>
                    One of the most useful functions for interaction is the <a
                        href="https://processing.org/reference/keyPressed_.html"><code>keyPressed()</code></a> method.</p>
                        <p>This method is called and run by a <i>Processing</i> sketch every time a key is pressed.
                        </p>
                        <p>This is important so let's say it again: any method that you specify in a sketch, that you give the name <code>keyPressed()</code>, will be run by your sketch every time you press any key on the keyboard.
                        </p>
                        <p>This is so important that I am going to say it again in bold: <b>any method that you specify in a sketch, that you give the name <code>keyPressed()</code>, will be run by your sketch every time you press any key on the keyboard.</b>
                        </p>
                        <p>You simply create a new method called <code>keyPressed()</code>, just as you have made methods to do all sorts of other things and as shown below, and <i>Processing</i> will automatically call this method every time it detects a <i>key press</i> interaction: every time a key is pressed on the keyboard</br>Let's try it!</p>

                </div>


                <h4>Ordered Characters Sketch</h4>

                <p>This is pretty, but we might want to do something a bit more structured with the input, like arrange
                    it in a way that shows sequence.</p>
                <img src="https://jsndyks.github.io/cityCreativeCoding/images/interaction/orderedCharacters.png" />
                <p>
                    To do this we'll need to store information about where we put each piece of <code>text()</code> that
                    we generate in response to a key press being detected in <code>keyPressed()</code>.
                    <br />
                    Hopefully you'll be thinking <i>global variables</i> as you are reading this?
                </p>
                <p>We'll use a <i>global variable</i> called <code>p</code> to store this positional information about how far along the canvas we want to plot our first letter and increment it by a few pixels each time a key is pressed - in the <code>keyPressed()</code> method so that subsequent letters are printed a bit further along.</p>
                <p>This should move each successive letter to the right. That is fine while <code>p</code> is less than <code>width</code>.
                    But our letters will plot off the right hand side of the canvas as we type more keys unless we do
                    something about this!</p>
                <p>A little bit of simple maths will work out where we put each successive value of <code>key</code> to the
                    right of the next ... until we get to the end of the screen canvas, at which point we need to head
                    back to the left and down a line.</p>
                <p>It's pretty straightforward ...</p>
                <ul>
                    <li style="padding-bottom:0.75em"><code>p % width</code> - uses the <a href="https://processing.org/reference/modulo.html">modulo
                            operator</a> <code>%</code>.<br />
                        This calculates the <i>remainder when one number is divided by another</i>.<br/>
                        So 110%100 is 10.<br/>
                        As is 210%100.<br/>
                        This is handy as any number <code>%width</code> gives us a position between <code>0</code> and <code>width</code>.
                        When we
                        get a number that is just more than width, this gives us a position back on the left hand side
                        of the canvas as <code>(width+1)%width</code> is <code>1</code>>! </li>
                    <li style="padding-bottom:0.75em"><code>24*int(p/width)</code> - firstly <a
                            href="https://processing.org/reference/divide.html">divide</a>s <code>p</code> by <code>width</code>. It
                        also uses the <code><a href="https://processing.org/reference/intconvert_.html">int()</a></code>
                        operator to convert the result to an integer. This means that we get a whole number - the number
                        of times <code>width</code> completely fits into <code>p</code>.
                        <br/>
                        So <code>int((width+1)/width)</code> is 1!<br/>
                        And <code>int((5*width+1)/width)</code> is 5.<br/>
                        It follows that int(110/100) is 1. And int(210/100) is 2.
                        If you think about it, this means we find out how may times <code>p</code> has filled our <code>width</code>
                        through this part of the calculation. Which tells us how many <i>lines</i> of length
                        <code>width</code> the characters have taken up. If we then multiply through by a number that is
                        bigger than our current letter height, like <b>24</b> or something, this will position text that
                        has a <code>p</code> value that is greater than <code>width</code> down the screen so that it does not
                        overlap.
                        I have added another <code>100</code> on in the script that follows so that the text does not start at the very top of
                        the screen.
                    </li>
                </ul>

    // -- the above just calculates a position for the text as p increases
    // -- use println() to print out the values to the console if you like

                <h4>KeyPressed Sketch with Control Flow</h4>
                <p>This is a good start, but we are likely want to <i>control program flow</i> from the keyboard.</p>
                <p>With any luck, you'll be thinking about <code>if</code> statements already, and how we might add them
                    into <code>keyPressed()</code> to respond to interaction from the keyboard.</p>
                <p>Here's how we might use one in <code>keyPressed()</code> to do things in a sketch depending upon
                    keyboard input - to clear the screen in this case.</p>

                <pre class="brush: processing; gutter: false; toolbar: false; ">
  void keyPressed() {
    // -- change program flow depending on value of key:
    if (key == ' ') {  // &lt;-- try changing the key that is pressed to clear
      background(240); // &lt;-- try changing the background colour used
    } else {
      p+=12; // -- add 12 to p each time &lt;-- try changing this to p-=4

      // -- put the char held in 'key' at a screen position
      // --   that increases in x and y with each key press
      text(key, p%width, 100 + 24*int(p/width));
    }
  }
</pre>

                <p>This code says ...</p>
                <blockquote>When a key is pressed, if the key is 'space', then fill the canvas with a light
                    grey,<br />otherwise add 12 to p and then put the value of key on the canvas at a position depending
                    on the value of p.</blockquote>
                <p>It's useful to be able to express your code like this - do practice!<br/>
                This is all we need you to be able to do at the end of <code><b>#BootCamp</b></code>: write a little bit of code that does something that you were unable to do previously - and <i>explain what it does</i>.</p>

                <h4>ColourKey Sketch</h4>
                <p>So far, our interaction has resulted in a <i>truly terrible</i> world processing package. Shocking.
                    Awful. Sorry about that!</p>
                <p>But we have been messing about like this to make sure you understand how to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Relate a key press to the <code>key</code> variable</li>
                    <li>Check which key has been pressed</li>
                    <li>See how we can detect and act on a key press with the <code>keyPressed()</code> method</li>
                    <li>Combine interactions with stuff you have learned before to do useful things - controlling the
                        flow in your sketch</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Hopefully you understand all of this and can do some of it, which makes it all worthwhile.</p>
                <p>However, it's <b>very important</b> that you don't get mixed up and think that <code>key</code> and
                    <code>keyPressed()</code> only enable us to do things with text. That's not the case - we can do
                    much more interesting things by responding to interaction through the keyboard.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can use the <code>keyPressed()</code> method to modify the contents of variables in your sketch
                    that do all sorts of things.
                    By combining void <code>keyPressed()</code> with the conditional code from the previous session, and
                    as we have seen above, you can modify any type of variable depending on the value of the input.
                </p>

                <!-- <p class="focusON"><code>#4</p> -->
                <p>
                    In the sketch below, a rectangle is drawn using the the <a
                        href="https://processing.org/reference/rect_.html" target="_blank"><code>rect()</code></a> method. The
                    rectangle is filled with colour (by a call to <a href="https://processing.org/reference/fill_.html"
                        target="_blank"><code>fill()</code></a>) using three global variables called <code>r</code>, <code>g</code> and
                    <code>b</code>. These represent the red, green and blue components of the colour.
                    Initially, the amount of red in the colour is 0 out of 255, the amount of green is 0 out of 255 and
                    likewise the amount of blue in the colour is 0 out of 255. So the overall colour given by
                    <code>fill(r, g, b)</code> is made of no red, no green and no blue.
                    That's a deep dark nightly new-moon <b>black</b>: <span style="background-color:#000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
                </p>

void draw() {
  background(254, 232, 134);
  fill(r, g, b);
  rect(50, 50, 100, 100);
}</pre>

                <p>But we can do something about this!<br />We can make our sombre rectangle 🙁 much more cheery 😁 with
                    some keyboard interaction.</p>

                <h3>3. What About the Mouse?</h3>
                <p>
                    So, we have a useful series of variables and methods to enable us to interact with and through the
                    keyboard.
                    But that only gets us so far - we can only specify a limited set of things as defined by the keys.<br/>
                    What if we want to identify locations on the screen.<br/>Quickly.<br/>With precision?<br />
                    I think you know where this is going, right?<br />
                </p>

                <p>Well, in the 1970s researchers at the <i>Xerox Research Centre</i> in <i>Palo Alto</i>, California were asking
                    themselves the same question:</p>
                <blockquote>What if we want to identify locations on the screen?<br />Quickly. With precision?<br />How
                    do we do that?</blockquote>
                <p>So they invented the mouse!</p>

                <p>It's hard to imagine just how innovative this mode of interaction was back then, and the kind of
                    computing and interaction it has enabled.</p>
                <p>One of these innovators was <b><a href="https://dl.acm.org/profile/81406592524">Stuart K. Card</a></b>, who worked in and subsequently led a hugely creative and productive team at
                    Xerox PARC from the mid 1970s until 2010.
                    One of the many things that he and his colleagues were thinking about back then (probably more
                    deeply than we just did) was how to get computers to know what we need of them.
                    They wanted to come up with devices that were easy to use and provided efficient and precise
                    interactions.
                </p>
                <p>In their mouse prototypes, wheels and rollers generated electronic signals (and squeaked a bit
                    sometimes), that reliably allowed a computer user to specify positions on a desk, that could in turn
                    be converted into positions on a screen.
                    This gives us an effective flexible and efficient new means of interacting with computers.</p>

                    Computing.</p>
                <p> I presented him with a much deserved <a

                <p>Nowadays, we have <i>trackpads</i> and <i>touch</i> and all sorts of other ways of identifying
                    coordinates and parts of the screen as we interact with computers.
                    But most of these derive from ideas first captured in the mouse by Stu and the Xerox pioneers   .</p>
                <p>Most mouse actions are about identifying areas of the screen, and <i>Processing</i> has some
                    excellent features for capturing where on the screen we are focusing as we use a mouse or similar
                    device.</p>

                <p>These methods and variables are in some ways similar to those used with the keyboard. 
                    And you know some of them and have already used them in some of your sketches.
                    Let's start with a summary table.</p>

                <p>OK, so you already know the global variables <code>mouseX</code> and <code>mouseY</code>.
                    These tell you something about how your sketch is being interacted with.</p>
                <p>Then we get to the <i>methods</i>, which are called whenever we <i>click</i>, <i>press</i>,
                    <i>release</i>, <i>move</i> or <i>drag</i> the mouse. Or whatever peripheral we are using to control
                    <i>where</i> on the screen we want to focus.
                </p>
                <p class="focusON"><code><span class="focusHash">#</span><span class="focusNum">6</span> - <b>mouseClicked()</b> : a method that runs when you click the 🐁</code></p>
                <p>
                    <i>Processing</i> supplies special methods for all of these events.<br/>
                    For example, <a href="https://processing.org/reference/mouseClicked_.html"
                        target="_blank">mouseClicked()</a> - <i>Processing</i> automatically detects a click of the mouse
                    and calls any method that you add to your sketch with this name whenever that happens.
                    So, if the mouse is clicked in a sketch, <i>Processing</i> looks for a method in the sketch called <a
                        href="https://processing.org/reference/mouseClicked_.html" target="_blank">mouseClicked()</a>,
                    and if it finds that you have defined one in your sketch, then it runs it.<br/>
                    This is, of course, a bit like <a
                    href="https://processing.org/reference/keyPressed_.html"><code>keyPressed()</code></a>, and works in much the same way.<br/>
                    Code in this method can do anything - <code>println()</code>, <code>background(255,0,0)</code>, whatever.<br/>
                    You decide what happens when the mouse is clicked.<br/>
                    You decide what happens upon the detected interaction.<br/>
                    Try these ideas! And others! Be creative!

                <h3>4. Interaction and State?</h3>

                <p>You should by now have your sketches working in all sorts of ways in response to interactions made through your keyboard and mouse.
                    That's great.</p>

                    <p class="focusON"><code><span class="focusHash">#</span><span class="focusNum">7</span> - <b>State</b> : recording what is going on in your sketch</code></p>
                    <p>But in explaining how to do things we have led you into <b>bad habits</b>.<br/>
                    That's not so great!<br/>So let's unpick things a little.
                </p>

                <p>This next section is an important bit, so make sure you have read it and understood it.<br/>
                Be a good friend - make sure your friends and neighbours have read it and understood it too.<br/>
                It will save you and them a lot of time (and perhaps some programming pain).</p>

                <h4>Detecting, Recording and Doing - How to Structure a Sketch for Interaction</h4>

                <p>Often people don't read those big red titles 👆.<br/>So I am going to write it again in black here.<br/>This section is about: "<b>How to Structure a Sketch for Interaction</b>".<br/>And you need to know this in order to make reliable interactive sketches.
                </p>

                <p>The key thing is that empty <code>draw()</code> loop!</p>
                <p>The <code>draw()</code> loop is the place to draw and do things.<br />
                    The event handling methods like <code>keyPressed()</code> and <code>mouseClicked()</code> are not the place for this.<br />
                    <b>Do not draw or do things in event handling methods like <code>keyPressed()</code> and <code>mouseClicked()</code><br/></b>
                    These methods are best for changing and recording <i>system state</i> - the way the sketch is configured at any time.<br />
                    The <code>draw()</code> loop is then the place to act on that state - to do the things requires by the interaction.</p>
                <p>In summary ... (actually read through this code 👇) ...</p>
                <pre class="brush: processing; gutter: false; toolbar: false; ">
// -- GLOBAL VARIABLES
// -- Declare and initialise variables that describe
// --   the initial state of your system, here.
// -- You will vary these to record the way that the state
// --   of your system varies over time in response to interactions.

// -- THE MAIN DRAW LOOP!

void draw() {
  // -- Do things in here
  // --   based upon variables set in the event handling methods
  // --   that describe the system state.
}

// -- THE EVENT HANDLING METHODS!

void keyPressed() {
  // -- Set variables here that describe the state of your sketch
  // --   based upon interactions and input.
  // -- These will be acted on in the draw() loop.
}

void mouseClicked() {
  // -- Set variables here that describe the state of your sketch
  // --   based upon interactions and input.
  // -- These will be acted on in the draw() loop.
}</pre>
                <p>So ... even more bluntly ... <b>Don't draw things in the event handling methods!</b>.</p>
                <p>Here is a refactoring of the <code>keyPressed</code> sketches that structures things as we advise
                    above.</p>
                <p>It's a little longer than the other examples, but should be readable.<br/>
                    Take your time to read it through and see how we have refactored things in line with this new advice.</p>

  } else {
    fill(64);
  }

  // -- check whether to add text:

    // -- add text at the mouse position:
    text(key, mouseX, mouseY);
    addText = false;
  }

  if (clearScreen) {
    // -- clear the screen: random light grey!
    background(int(random(180, 240)));
    // -- reset system state:
    clearScreen = false;
  }
}

// -- INTERACT : detect things in these event handling methods
// --   that establish and record system state:
void keyPressed() {
  // -- set variable to record current state:
  addText = true;

  // -- set variable to record current state:
  if (key == 'r' || key =='R') {
    isRed = true;
  }
}

void mouseClicked() {
  // -- set variable to record current state:
  clearScreen = true;
}</pre>

                <p>One of the reasons we didn't organise the other examples in this way was to keep them short and sweet
                    as we introduced concepts.</p>
                <p>But we need you to understand how to ...</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>detect and capture interaction</li>
                    <li>use it to set variables that describe the state of your system (sketch)</li>
                    <li>check these in the <code>draw()</code> loop to control flow based upon inputs acquired through
                        interaction</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This gives you plenty of scope for producing exciting, imaginative, quick, interactive sketches.</p>

                            href="https://processing.org/reference/random_.html" target="_blank">random()</a></code><br/>
                        Modify your code to add and display a second variable <code>randomNum</code>, that contains a

                <h4>Hang on, that's not an interface!</h4>
                <p>You are now equipped with many ways of interacting with sketches and should be able to produce
                    wonderfully interactive work. All it requires is a bit of practice and a lot of imagination.
                    And a few of those <b>predict</b>, <b>change</b>, <b>observe</b>, <b>think</b> (and discuss), <b>learn</b>, <b>confirm</b> loops ...
                    that <i>Stu Card</i> and his <i>Xerox Research Centre</i> colleagues would have used when they were designing their interface devices back in the 1970s.</p>

                <p class="focusON"><code><span class="focusHash">#</span><span class="focusNum">9</span> - <b>HUH?</b> : that's not a graphical user interface?</code></p>
                <p>We have deliberately <b>not</b> focussed on some of the standard windows style interface elements
                    here - we're getting under the bonnet of these interfaces to give you scope for making more
                    interesting, innovative and inspiring interactions!<br />But maybe we should show you how you can
                    use what you know to make them!</p>
                <p>Here's a basic example:</p>
                <pre class="brush: processing; gutter: false; toolbar: false; ">int x, y, size;
boolean isIn = false;    // -- is the mouse in the rect()?
boolean isOn = false;    // -- is the checkbutton on?

void setup()
{
  size(400, 400);
  x = width/4;
  y = height/4;
  size = width/15;
}

// -- The draw() loop - here is where we control flow and draw things!
void draw()
{
  if (isOn) {
    // -- yellow if on!
    background(255, 255, 140);
  } else {
    // -- white if not!
    background(255);
  }

  // -- change colour to be used in rect based on status:
  if (isIn) {
    fill(255, 128, 64);
  } else if (isOn) {
    fill(255, 0, 0);
  } else {
    fill(240);
  }

  // -- the main rectangle - always shown :
  rect(x, y, size, size);

  fill(64, 200);
  // -- things to show based on status!
  if (isOn) {
    // -- middle rectangle and reminder text :
    rect(x+size*0.25, y+size*0.25, size*0.5, size*0.5);
    text("Remember to turn me off before you leave ...", 120, height-10);
    text("On", x+size*1.5, 15+height/4);
  } else {
    text("Off", x+size*1.5, 15+height/4);
  }
}


// -- Event handling methods:
// --   here is where we detect interactions and capture them in variables...

// -- Processing will call this method whenever the mouse is moved:
void mouseMoved()
{
  // -- is mouse position inside the rectangle?
  if  ((mouseX &gt; x/2) && (mouseY &gt;y) && (mouseX &lt; x+size) && (mouseY &lt; y+size))
  {
    isIn = true;
  } else {
    isIn = false;
  }
}

// -- Processing will call this method whenever the mouse is clicked:
void mouseClicked()
{
  // -- is mouse position inside the rectangle?
  if  ((mouseX &gt; x/2) && (mouseY &gt;y) && (mouseX &lt; x+size) && (mouseY &lt; y+size))
  {
    // -- switch isON to whatever it is not - shorthand follows on the next line (try it):
    // -- isOn = !isOn
    if (isOn) {
      isOn = false;
    } else {
      isOn = true;
    }
  }
}</pre>

                <p>The key thing to see here is the way that we check whether the mouse is in the rectangle or not with
                    some basic comparisons of the mouse position with the extent of the rectangle.</p>
