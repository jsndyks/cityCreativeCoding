          These exercises give you practice with defining keyboard and mouse inputs that make your sketches <b>interactive</b>.
          <br/>We do so by updating and changing the state of global variables that affect the behaviour of the sketch.
      </p>
      <p>We expect you to work on all of the <b>CORE TASKS</b>, and pretty much complete them.<br/>Do something like this ...:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Try it out</li>
        <li>See if it works</li>
        <li>Try something else </li>
        <li>See if it works</li>
        <li>Ask a friend or teacher - show then your commented code, the behaviour of the sketch and any error messages</li>
        <li>Try again </li>
        <li>Dive into the excellent <a href="https://processing.org/reference"><i>Processing</i> Reference Materials</a> and keep trying </li>
      </ol>
      <p>And not necessarily in that order.<br/>But we want to encourage you to experiment, try things out, learn from error messages and observed behaviours and problem solve.</p>

      <div class="coreTask">
    <p>These <b style="color:#940">orange</b> tasks should done right away.<br/>

        <h3>Core Tasks</h3>

        <p>OK, we are going to try four tasks that will build on the concepts and code that we introduced in the <a href="https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/mod/page/view.php?id=420874">Interaction Interactive Lecture</a>. Make sure you have understood and completed all of the tasks in there before you try these!</p>

        <hr/>

        <h4>1. Move</h4>
        <p>The whole idea of studying <i>Interaction</i> is that it enables you (or others) to control a sketch with your mouse and keyboard once it is running. <br/>We can control colours, positions, behaviours ... pretty much anything really.<br/>And that's what many sophisticated sketches do.</p>
        <p>Let's start by making something move.</p>
        <img src="https://jsndyks.github.io/cityBootCamp/images/interaction/movingShape.png"/>

        <div class="coreTask">
            <h5>Move Task</h5>
            <p>
                Create a new sketch that draws a square in the centre of a square window sized 400 by 400.<br/>
                Use two global variables <code>float x</code> and <code>float y</code> to specify the position of the square - at <code>width/2, height/2</code>:
                <br />
            <pre class="brush: processing; gutter: false; toolbar: false; ">
void draw()
{
  rect(x, y, 60, 60);
}
</pre>
</p>
            <p>
            Remember you have to declare those variables at the top of your sketch and you should initialise them with
            appropriate values inside <code>setup()</code>, so that your square is positioned correctly when your sketch
            starts.
            <br /><br />
            Run your sketch to check it behaves as expected.
            <br /><br />
            Now add a <code>keyPressed()</code> method to the sketch that maps the <span class="key">w</span> and <span class="key">s</span> keys to commands that increment and decrement
            the variable <code>y</code> by a value of 1 respectively.<br/>
            The condition in <code>keyPressed()</code> that gives you the keyboard interaction will look something like this:
            <pre class="brush: processing; gutter: false; toolbar: false; ">
if (key == 'w') {
// -- do something in here that moves the rectangle up!
}
</pre>
            Really think about the coordinate system and how pressing <span class="key">w</span> will move the square up here.
            <br /><br />
            Add conditions to <code>keyPressed()</code> that map the <span class="key">a</span> and <span class="key">d</span> keys to commands that increment and decrement the variable <code>x</code> by a value
            of 1 respectively.
            <br /><br />
            Run your sketch to check you can move the square around the canvas using the <span class="key">a</span>, <span class="key">d</span>, <span class="key">s</span> and <span class="key">w</span> keys.
          </p>
          </div>

          <p style="margin-top:2em">
            This is pretty cool - you have an interactive sketch!<br/>Show your friends, show your tutor.<br/>Celebrate!</p>
          <p>But not too much ... because there are a few more features and tricks that you should try later in the <b>challenges</b> section - they will serve you well.
          <br/>So carry on with these <b>CORE Tasks</b> for now and we can try the <b>Move</b> challenges later.</p>

        <hr/>

        <!-- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ -->

        <h4>2. Colour</h4>
        <p>This kind of interaction can be used to control almost anything in your sketch: shapes, positions, colours, sizes ... all sorts of behaviours.<br/>Let's change the <i>colour</i> of a shape according to input from the keyboard for starters.</p>

        <img src="https://jsndyks.github.io/cityBootCamp/images/interaction/redGreyBlue.png"/>

        <div class="coreTask">
            <h5>Colour Task</h5>
            <p>
                Start a new sketch with a <code>void setup()</code> method that sets the size of the sketch canvas to 400 by 400.
                <br /><br />
                Initialise a new variable called <code>red</code> with a value of 128.
                <br /><br />
                Add a <code>void draw()</code> method that contains the following code:
                <br />
            <pre class="brush: processing; gutter: false; toolbar: false; ">
void draw()
{
  background(100);
  fill(red, 128, 128);
  rect(100, 100, 60, 60);
}
</pre>
            <br />
            Use <i>Processing</i>'s <code>void keyPressed()</code> method to increment the value of <code>red</code> by 10 for every press of
            the <span class="key">R</span> key.<br/>
            Add another interaction that decrements the value or <code>red</code> by 10 for every press of the <span class="key">r</span> key.
          </p>
        </div>

        <p>That's pretty good, but with a few more commands and a little more creative thinking you can create a full <i>RGB colour selector</i>!</p>
        <p>You can try this in the <b>Red Green Blue Selector</b> challenge later - but for now ... let's move on to Task 3.</p>


        <!-- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ -->
        <!-- <h4>3. Password Reader.</h4> -->

        <hr/>

<h4>3. Splash</h4>
<p>This is a really nice one to try - it's not too difficult, and is pretty open ended. There's lots of room for creative ideas.</p>
<p>Let's use what we have learned to add some interactions that allow you to rapidly change a dynamic display ... and perhaps even get a little creative!</p>
<br/><br/>

<img src="https://jsndyks.github.io/cityBootCamp/images/interaction/colourPic.png"/>

<div class="coreTask">
    <h5>Splash Task</h5>
    <p>Make a big canvas in <code>setup()</code> and give it a white <code><a href="https://processing.org/reference/background_.html">background()</a></code>.</p>
    <p>Add a <code>draw()</code> method that draws a circle with your favourite <code>fill()</code> wherever the mouse is positioned.</p>
    <p>The circle should have no outline -  <code><a href="https://processing.org/reference/noStroke_.html">noStroke()</a></code></p>
    <p>A new circle should be drawn wherever the mouse moves, and so your mouse will leave a trail. You must make sure you have no <code><a href="https://processing.org/reference/background_.html">background()</a></code> command in <code>draw()</code>. This would wipe the background clear in every <code>draw()</code> loop. We want a trail of coloured circles.</p>
    <p>Now update the colour of the circle depending on the position of the mouse - so that there is more <b>red</b> in the colour as the mouse moves right and more <code>blue</code> in the colour as the mouse moves down.<br/>
    Just use <code>mouseX</code> and <code>mouseY</code> somewhere in the RGB colour definition.</p>
    <p>
    This should look quite cool and colourful - particularly if you have a circles with some transparency.
    Remember, the fourth argument given to the <code><a href="https://processing.org/reference/fill_.html">fill()</a></code> command is the <i>alpha</i> channel, which sets the transparency.</p>
  </div>

  <p>Nice. You could make a spray paint app out of this. The <b>Colourier Spray Splash challenge</b> asks you to do just that, and gives you some ideas as to how you might go about doing so.<br/>
    Try it later, after you have completed the four <b>CORE</b> tasks - nearly there.<br/>
    But for now ... we're <i>hunting</i> ...</p>
  <hr/>

<h4>4. Target</h4>
<p>We can use the detection of events, and the creation of shapes on screen to produce simple games - like a <i>target hunter</i>.</p>
<p>One very useful method is <code><a href="https://processing.org/reference/dist_.html">dist()</a></code> - which calculates the distance between two points.<br/>  The <a href="https://processing.org/examples/distance2d.html">Distance2D sketch</a> shows how nicely this can be tied to interactions.<br/>Try it - just follow 👆 that link and interact.</p>
<img src="https://jsndyks.github.io/cityBootCamp/images/interaction/distance2D.png"/>
<p>But let's not get ahead of ourselves!<br/>For now, rather handily, <code><a href="https://processing.org/reference/dist_.html">dist()</a></code> allows us to calculate the distance between the mouse position and the centre of a circle. This can tell us whether the mouse is either:</p>
<ul>
  <li><i>inside</i> the circle - closer to the circle's centre than its radius, or</li>
  <li><i>outside</i> the circle - further from the circle's centre than its radius</li>
</ul>
<p>A key <i>code-snippet</i> looks something like :
</p>
<pre class="brush: processing; gutter: false; toolbar: false; ">
// -- check on distance from mouse to circle centre:
if (dist(circleX,circleY,mouseX,mouseY) &lt; radius) {
  // -- within circle - do something
  fill(255,128,64);
} else {
  // -- outside circle - do something else
  fill(255);
}

// -- draw the circle
ellipse(circleX,circleY,radius,radius);</pre>

        <div class="coreTask">
            <h5>Target Task</h5>

            <p>
                Write code that produces a circle in your favourite <code>fill()</code> colour at a random position on the screen.<br/>
                Each time you <i>move</i> the mouse inside the circle highlight it in some way, with a different <code>fill()</code> or <code>stroke()</code> or <code>strokeWeight()</code>.
              </p>
              <p>
                When you click inside the circle, redraw it at a random position within the sketch and at a random size.
              </p><p>
                Before you start writing code consider the global variables and the functions you will need to implement
                the behaviour of your sketch. A good approach would be break the behaviour of the sketch down into
                smaller testable goals, for example:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Make a list of global variables and discuss it with one of the lab staff;</li>
                <li>Draw a centred circle and test that it's in the right place - draw it at (0,0) or add a <code><a href="https://processing.org/reference/point_.html">point()</a></code> in a different colour at the centre after you have drawn it);</li>
                <li>Add the click detection and test - based on the <i>code-snippet</i> provided above;</li>
                <li>Update the circle position;</li>
                <li>Update the circle size;</li>
            </ul>

            <i>Hints:</i>
            <ul>
                <li>To detect whether the click is within the circle you can use <i>Processing</i>'s <code><a
                        href="https://processing.org/reference/dist_.html" target="_blank">dist()</a></code> method.</li>
                        <li>To test whether the mouse is in the circle consider printing "inside" to the console when it is.</li>
                        <li>To test for the click detection consider printing "Click" to the console when you click the mouse button.</li>
                <li>To test whether the click is inside the circle consider printing "Hit" or "Miss" to the console.</li>
                <li>To set the position of the circle to a random position you can use <i>Processing</i>'s <code><a
                        href="https://processing.org/reference/random_.html" target="_blank">random()</a></code> method.</li>
                <li>Make sure you <code><a href="https://processing.org/reference/constrain_.html">constrain</a></code> the positions and the circle size so the circle stays within the sketch and is big enough to see and click!</li>
            </ul>

        </div>
        <br /><br />

        <h3>Challenges</h3>

        <p>If you managed to complete the four tasks and the day isn't over then this is the place for you - we're in the <b>CHALLENGE</b> zone.</p>
        <p>Actually <b>CHALLENGE</b> may not be the right term here - as these are all pretty straightforward <b>enhancements</b> to the sketches that you produced above. It should be fun to try to complete them and doing this will certainly help you learn. You may want to try them with a colleague - there is no harm in discussing approaches and coming up with a collective plan.</p>

        <h4>1+. Super Move.</h4>

        <p>If you managed the <b>Move</b> exercise, you can try a few more useful extensions to add to your sketch.</p>
        <p>This exercise is not obligatory, but we recommend that you give it a try and expect most of you to be able to do it.</p>
        <p>Don't forget to document your code with explanatory comments, save progress regularly and ask for help and show your teachers how you are doing.</p>


        <div class="challenge">
            <h5>Super Move Challenge</h5>
            <p>If you want to push things a bit, and learn a little more, by enhancing this interactive sketch then try this <b>challenge</b> that will extend the sketch to  <b>constrain!</b>, <b>report!</b> and <b>change!</b>:</p>

            <h5>Constrain!</h5>
            <p>It's pretty easy to keep the shape on the canvas ...</p>
            <p>
          <b>Extension 1a:</b> Add <code>if</code> statements to prevent the values of <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> becoming less than 0 or more than 400. Use <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> (rather than 400) so that things still work if the sketch changes size!
          <br /><br />
          <b>Extension 1b: </b> Add <code>if</code> statements to allow the square to go up to, but not past, the bounds of the sketch.
          <br /><br />
          <b>Extension 1c: </b> Can you find and use a <i>Processing</i> command that will <a href="https://processing.org/reference/constrain_.html">constrain</a> the extents of <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> in a single method?<br/>
          This may work better, and be clearer to read, than all of those <code>if</code> statements.
        </p>

        <h5>Report!</h5>
        <p>We probably want to know something about what is going on in the sketch ...</p>
          <p>
          <b>Extension 2a:</b> Add code to the <code>draw()</code> method that displays the <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> position of the
          rectangle in the bottom corner of the sketch.<br/>
          The text should update when the position of the rectangle is changed.
          <br /><br />
          <b>Extension 2b:</b> Add conditions to the <code>keyPressed()</code> method that move the square more quickly if CAPITAL <span class="key">A</span>, <span class="key">D</span>, <span class="key">S</span> or <span class="key">W</span> are pressed.<br/>Just add four more conditions based on the value of <code>key</code>.
          <br /><br />
          <b>Extension 2c:</b> Add code to the <code>draw()</code> method that displays the letter of the most recently pressed <code>key</code> inside the rectangle.
          </p>

          <h5>Change!</h5>
          <p>Add an interaction that changes the status of the sketch, and the behaviour of the sketch as a result ...</p>
            <p>
              <b>Extension 3a:</b> Can you change the colour of the shape as it moves? Use <code>fill()</code> and vary the parameters according to the position of the shape.
              <br/><br/>
            <b>Extension 3b:</b> Add a boolean global variable called <code>isSquare</code> with <code>isSquare = true;</code><br/>
            This will store information about the status of your sketch: is the shape a square or not?<br/>
            Well, at the moment it is, but can you add an interaction that enables us to vary this?<br/>
            For example, use a key interaction to toggle <code>isSquare</code> from <code>true</code> to <code>false</code>.<br/>
            <br/><br/>
            <b>Extension 3c:</b> Add a condition to the <code>keyPressed()</code> method that changes <code>isSquare</code> to <code>false</code> if you click a particular key.<br/><br/>
            <b>Extension 3d:</b> Now add a condition in the <code>draw()</code> loop that checks whether <code>isSquare</code> is <code>true</code> and draws a <code>rect()</code> (a square one) or an <code>ellipse()</code> dependent upon this.<br/><br/>
            <b>Extension 3e:</b> You have probably figured out by now that you'll need another condition in <code>keyPressed()</code> that enables you to make <code>isSquare</code> <code>true</code> again - so add one of these!<br/>
            Note that you can toggle a boolean variable by setting it to its inverse: <code>isSquare = !isSquare;</code>
            <br/><br/>
            <b>Extension 3f:</b> So how would you add an option to make the shape a <code><a href="https://processing.org/reference/triangle_.html">triangle()</a></code>?<br/><br/>

            </p>

      </div>
      <br /><br />
      <hr/>

      <h4>2+. Colour Selector</h4>

      <p>Can you extend the colour specification functionality a little to produce something much more useful.</p>

      <div class="challenge">
          <h5>Colour Selector Challenge</h5>
        <p><b>Extension 1:</b> Add statements that prevent the value of red becoming less than 0 or more than 255.</p>
        <p><b>Extension 2:</b> Add statements that change the <b>green</b> and <b>blue</b> colour components with <span class="key">G</span>/<span class="key">g</span> and <span class="key">B</span>/<span class="key">b</span>.</p>
        <p><b>Extension 3:</b> Add statements that show the currently selected colour by adding <code>text()</code> that contains a <code>String</code> that shows all three colours - e.g.</p>
<pre class="brush: processing; gutter: false; toolbar: false; ">
// -- initialise a string to hold colour details
String colourDefinition = "";

// -- update with the current colour:
colourDefinition = "rgb("+red+","+green+","+blue")"
// -- the + signs above just stick the text together

      <h4>3+. Spray Splash</h4>

      <p>You have the basics, but we can do loads more with this sketch with a few more commands!</p>

      <div class="challenge">
        <h5>Spray Splash Challenge</h5>

        <p>Enhance the sketch by varying the colour depending upon whether the <span class="key">r</span>, <span class="key">g</span> or <span class="key">b</span> keys were most recently pressed.<br/>
          <ul>
            <li><span class="key">r</span> - <b>red</b> varies with <code>x</code>, <b>green</b> varies with <code>y</code></li>
              <li><span class="key">g</span> - <b>green</b> varies with <code>x</code>, <b>blue</b> varies with <code>y</code></li>
                <li><span class="key">b</span> - <b>blue</b> varies with <code>x</code>, <b>red</b> varies with <code>y</code></li>
          </ul>
          This will involve a condition that depends upon what is held in <code>key</code> and you'll need <code><a href="https://processing.org/reference/else.html">if</a></code> and <code><a href="https://processing.org/reference/else.html">else if</a></code> to control what happens dependent upon this interaction.<br/>
        </p>
        <p>Have a play and then decide whether you want to really go for it by ... <br/>
          Varying the colour in three additional ways depending upon whether the <span class="key">R</span>, <span class="key">G</span> or <span class="key">B</span> keys were most recently pressed.<br/>
          <ul>
            <li><span class="key">R</span> - <b>red</b> varies with <code>x</code>, <b>blue</b> varies with <code>y</code></li>
              <li><span class="key">G</span> - <b>green</b> varies with <code>x</code>, <b>red</b> varies with <code>y</code></li>
                <li><span class="key">B</span> - <b>blue</b> varies with <code>x</code>, <b>green</b> varies with <code>y</code></li>
          </ul>
          This will involve extending the condition that depends upon what is held in <code>key</code>.<br/>
        </p>
        <p>Then think about some other things you might do here ... <br/>
          <ol>
            <li>Vary the opacity of the colour depending on a mouse click - this is the fourth argument given to a <code><a href="https://processing.org/reference/fill_.html">fill()</a></code> command - the <i>alpha</i> channel.</li>
            <li>Change the size of the circle depending upon some mouse or keyboard interaction - you may want to <code><a href="https://processing.org/reference/constrain_.html">constrain()</a></code> this to a sensible range!</li>
            <li>Add a <code><a href="https://processing.org/reference/random_.html">random()</a></code> element that positions the circle <i>around the mouse position</i> rather than directly on it.<br/>If you get this right, it should emulate a spray can.<br/>
              Of course, the amount of randomness itself could be determined by a interaction through mouse or keyboard.</li>
            <li>Add some other randomness!</li>
          </ol>
          There really are lots of possibilities, even given the limited commands we have explored already.<br/>
          Be creative!

  <p>OK - you should be able to make something quite pretty now ...?!</p>
