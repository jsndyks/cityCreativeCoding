        <div class="intro">

       <p>
            In the <i>Objects &amp; Classes</i> lecture we tried to show some simple, and increasingly functional and sophisticated (though still quite simple) classes involving Robots. I made a couple of mistakes, and was a bit rushed. Here's a more measured description that may help you make classes.
        </p>
        </div>

        <div class="units-row">

            <p>
                This page involves a little preparation and then uses 5 different ways of creating a simple robot in processing:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li style="padding-bottom:0.5em"><b>Preparation</b> - some sketching to establish the coordinates and characteristics of a simple representation of a robot</li>
                <li style="padding-bottom:0.5em"><b>Methods</b> - we use a <i>method</i> to draw a robot using a series of shapes based these coordinates and characteristics - just like we have done before</li>
                <li style="padding-bottom:0.5em"><b>A Mark 1 Robot</b> - <code>RobotMk1</code>: the simplest class we can write, that does nothing at all, but shows the syntax you use for creating a class and then declaring and instantiating an object that is of this type.</li>
                <li style="padding-bottom:0.5em"><b>A Mark 2 Robot</b> - <code>RobotMk2</code>: this class contains a little data and has a method that enables an instantiated object to draw itself if called.</li>
                <li style="padding-bottom:0.5em"><b>A Mark 3 Robot</b> - <code>RobotMk3</code>: a basic class that adds a little more - these robots have more features when drawn and can be instantiated with arguments, meaning that each object can hold data, data that is specific to that instance of the class. So we can have multiple robots that have different characteristics as defined on their instantiation with this class.</li>
                <li style="padding-bottom:0.5em"><b>A Mark 4 Robot</b> - <code>RobotMk4</code>: the most sophisticated class that involves four fields in which data are stored and two methods that capture robot behaviours <code>move()</code> and <code>draw()</code>, both of which involve some animation.</li>
                <li style="padding-bottom:0.5em"><b>Correction</b> - finally I explain, having had some feedback from a keen-eyed first year (<i>thank-you!</ÃŸi>), why I was unable to get the final sketch to work in class ... it was all about <i>scope</i>!</li>
            </ol>
            <p>We would like you to try each of the examples to get the hand of creating classes and using objects in your code.</p>
            <p>
                All of the code that is used is available on the page below, so you can copy this into a <i>Processing</i> sketch to se how it works, and also in a single <i>Processing</i> sketch, that you should download.
            </p>

            </ul>
            <p>Use the discussion forum to discuss you progress, blocking points, ideas and robots!</p>

            </div>

            <h3>1. Preparation - Sketches and Coordinates</h3>

            <p>Sketch a robot head with four simple shapes - a rectangle, two circles and a line.</p>
            <p>Find the coordinates of the robot head centred around the origin (0,0).<br/>
            Note that in this sketch, for no sensible reason at all, we are using <i>standard coordinates</i>, in <i>Processing</i> the vertical <i>Y-axis</i> increases from top to bottom.</p>
            <p>Use the coordinates to determine these <i>six key variables</i> that allow us to draw the head ...</p>
            <ul>
                <li><code>float headWide</code></li>
                <li><code>float headHigh</code></li>
                <li><code>float eyeDistance</code></li>
                <li><code>float eyeRadius</code></li>
                <li><code>float mouthLong</code></li>
                <li><code>float mouthDown</code></li>
            </ul>

            <h3>2. Methods - A Collection of Shapes</h3>

            <p>Let's use this information as a series of arguments to a <i>method</i> that will draw the Robot.</p>
            <p>We have done this kind of thing before when creating <i>Trees</i> and <i>Roundels</i> and things as we introduced <i>methods</i>.</p>

            <pre class="brush: processing; gutter: false; toolbar: false;">  // -- drawRobot method:
    void drawRobot (float x, float y, float headWide, float headHigh,
        float eyeDist, float eyeRad, float mouthLong, float mouthDown) {
        
        // -- draw the head with the rect() method:
        noStroke();
        fill(220);
        rect(x,y,headWide,headHigh);

        // -- draw the eyes with the circle() method:
        fill(32);
        circle(x-eyeDist/2, y, eyeRad);
        circle(x+eyeDist/2, y, eyeRad);

        // -- draw the mouth with the line() method():
        stroke(32);
        strokeWeight(3);
        line(x-mouthLong/2, y+mouthDown, x+mouthLong/2, y+mouthDown);
    }
            </pre>

            <p>Declare and initialise variables to contain your data, and then add a call to this <i>method</i> in the <code>draw()</code> <i>method</i> of your sketch, to draw the robot.</p>
            <pre class="brush: processing; gutter: false; toolbar: false;">// -- Method approach to drawing:
    drawRobot(x,y, wide,high, eyeD, eyeR, mLong, mDown);
            </pre>

            <div class="figRight" style="padding:1em; padding-left:4em">
                <figure>
                <img src="./img/cc.objects.robotHead.method.png" width="200" alt="A Robot produced via a method"/>
                </figure>
                <figcaption style="margin-top:-2.5em">Using a Method.<br/>We can draw a collection of shapes<br/>that are configured by method parameters.</figcaption>
            </div>


            <p>So, we can draw a robot, and we could draw more with different configurations by calling the <i>method</i> again with different input parameters, we could even relate this to interactions with <code>mouseX</code> and <code>mouseY</code> as input parameters, or add animation with <code>frameCount%width</code> as a parameter ...</p>

            <pre class="brush: processing; gutter: false; toolbar: false;">// -- Method approach to drawing:
  drawRobot(x,y, wide,high, eyeD, eyeR, mLong, mDown);
  drawRobot(x+150,y, wide,high, eyeD, eyeR, mLong, mDown);
  drawRobot(x,y+120, wide/2,high/2, eyeD/3, eyeR, mLong/2, mDown/1.5);
  drawRobot(x+150,y+120, wide/2,high/2, eyeD/2, eyeR/3, mLong/3, mDown/2.5);
  for (int i=100; i&lt;width; i+=100) {
    drawRobot(i,y-120, wide/2,high/2, i/100*eyeD/3, eyeR/4, mLong/3, mDown/2.5);
  }</pre>

              <p>But... this is <i>just a collection of shapes</i>. Our robot does not have behaviours.</p>


            <h3>3. Mark 1 - The Simplest 'Nothing' Class</h3>

            <p>So let's create a robot <i>class</i>, which will enable us to address this.
                Remember that the <i>Processing</i> documentation helpfully and effectively defines a <a href="https://processing.org/reference/class.html"><code>class</code></a> as:</p>
            <blockquote>a composite of fields (data) and methods (functions that are a part of the class) which may be instantiated as objects.</blockquote>

            <p>We use the <a href="https://processing.org/reference/class.html"><code>class</code></a> keyword to define one of these composites, and here's the simplest example I can come up with of a robot class that takes advantage of this <i>Processing</i> capability and uses the expected syntax:</p>

            <pre class="brush: processing; gutter: false; toolbar: false;">// -- Very Basic Robot class that does ... er ... nothing!
// -- Useless!
    
    class RobotMk1 {
        
        // -- The constructor method is called each time an object of this class type is instantiated.
        // -- Each class definition needs one, and its name is the same as the class name.
        // -- This one does nothing at all, but try adding a println() statement in there.
        RobotMk1 () {
        }
        
    }
</pre>

            <p>Having define a class we can use it to create one or more <i>objects</i> that are instances of that class.<br/>
            So we can now make a Mark1 robot of type <code>RobotMk1</code> just as we would create any variable.
            But this variable is an object and so it is ... "<i>a composite of fields (data) and methods (functions that are a part of the class)</i>". 
            Or at least it could be if we had defined a class with fields and methods, but this class has no data or methods so it's pretty useless.</p>
            <p>We can still declare and instantiate variables of this type though. Try adding the class to your sketch in a new tab titled <i>RobotMk1</i> and declaring an instance or two in <code>setup()</code> to see that it is possible:</p>
            <pre class="brush: processing; gutter: false; toolbar: false;">// -- Very Basic Robot class that does ... er ... nothing!
    RobotMk1 r  = new RobotMk1();
    RobotMk1 r2 = new RobotMk1();
    RobotMk1 c3po = new RobotMk1();</pre>
            <p>We now have three robots in our sketch, but they don't contain any data that describes them or allows us to differentiate them (variables), or do anything like draw themselves or move (methods).</p>
            <p>But we can easily add this kind of thing now that we can see how easy it is to make a class.</p>

            <div class="figRight" style="padding:1em; padding-left:4em">
                <figure>
                <img src="./img/cc.objects.robotHead.robotMk2.png" width="200" alt="A Robot produced via a method"/>
                </figure>
                <figcaption style="margin-top:-2.5em">A Robot Class.<br/>Our RobotMk2 class is very simple,<br/>but at least it draws something!</figcaption>
            </div>


            <h3>4. Mark 2 - A Class that Does Something (not much) - the 'Something' Class</h3>

            <p>All we do to add <i>data</i> to a <code>class</code> is define it with <i>instance variables</i> or <i>fields</i>.</p>
            <p>These are declared as variables within the <code>class</code> definition, but <i>outside</i> the constructor and any other methods, a little like <i>global variables</i> in our sketches.</p>
            <p>You can see them declared here in this more sophisticated <i>RobotMk2</i> <code>class</code>, and then instantiated in the constructor method that runs whenever an instance of the <code>class</code> is declared.</p>
            <p>Now we add a <i>method</i> to the <code>class</code> to give it behaviours. The example <i>method</i> here is called <code>draw()</code> and you should be able to see what it does - it draws a rectangle, the position of which is defined by the values of the two instance variables associated with each particular object, each instance of the class that is declared and instantiated in any sketch.</p>
            <pre class="brush: processing; gutter: false; toolbar: false; highlight: [7,11,12]">// -- Very Basic Robot class that holds data and has a method to draw itself.
// -- Unsatisfactory!
    
class RobotMk2 {

    // -- fields, or instance variables that each instance of this class will hold:
    float x, y;

    // -- constructor can act on fields when an instance is instantiated:
    RobotMk2 () {
        x = 100; // -- or try : x = random(50,width-50);
        y = 100; // -- or try : y = random(50,height-50);
    }

    // -- method that can be called by instances of this class
    void draw() {
        fill(200);
        strokeWeight(1);
        rect(x, y, 30, 20);
    }
}</pre>
            <p>In your sketch you can declare and instantiate an object of this class like this - try doing so as a <i>global</i> variable outside the <i>Processing</i> methods.</p>
<pre class="brush: processing; gutter: false; toolbar: false;">// -- Something class: make a new RobotMk2 called 'r':
RobotMk2 r = new RobotMk2();</pre>

            <p>Then call the <code>draw()</code> method for this object in either the <code>setup()</code> or <code>draw()</code> methods - you should be able to predict and explain the effects of doing so in either method.</p>
<pre class="brush: processing; gutter: false; toolbar: false;">// -- Call the draw() method of the 'r' object:
r.draw();</pre>

            <p>These robots are not particularly impressive, but they do contain positional data and functionality to draw themselves. Try playing with the initial settings for the <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> instance variables, and create and draw a few robot instances (objects) in your sketch.<br/> You may want to declare and instantiate robots through multiple statements, or you may try to use and <i>array</i> and a <i>loop</i>.
            Use the code that follows to help achieve this in your sketch.</p>

            <pre class="brush: processing; gutter: false; toolbar: false;">// -- Make some more robot instances - we could make an array of robots.

    // -- Declare global array at the top of the sketch outside any methods:
    RobotMk2 [] robotArray = new RobotMk2[10];

    // -- Instantiate array elements in the setup() method:
    for (int i=0; i&lt;10; i++) {
        robotArray[i] = new RobotMk2 ();
    }

    // -- Draw the robots in the draw() method:
    for (RobotMk2 r : robotArray) {
        r.draw();
    }</pre>

    <div class="figRight" style="padding:1em; padding-left:4em">
        <figure>
        <img src="./img/cc.objects.robotHead.robotMk3.png" width="200" alt="A Robot produced via a class"/>
        </figure>
        <figcaption style="margin-top:-2.5em">A Robot Class.<br/>Our RobotMk3 takes arguments that<br/>allow us to configure instances (objects)!</figcaption>
    </div>

    <h3>5. Mark 3 - A Class that Takes Arguments - the 'Something Else' Class</h3>

            <p>It should now be clear that we can create a more sophisticated looking robot by adding some commands to the <code>draw()</code> method of the class. That's pretty easy, particularly if we use our sketchbook to help, and we do so below with <i>head</i>, <i>eyes</i> and <i>mouth</i> (but still no body) below.</p>

            <p>But what is new and exciting is that we can pass arguments to our object, to configure it individually, if we define these in the constructor class - just as we do with objects available in <i>Processing</i>like <a href="https://processing.org/reference/PVector.html"><code>PVector</code></a>.</p>

            <p>All we have to do here is define the arguments and their <i>type</i> in the brackets that hold arguments for the constructor, as shown below.</p>
            <p>In this <code>class</code>, we have <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> as <i>fields</i> or <i>instance variables</i> that are defined at the top of the class definition. We also have local variables that are passed into the constructor that are used to set these <i>fields</i> or <i>instance variables</i>. In this case theses have <i>the same name</i>, which means that they need to be differentiated, so in the constructor we refer to the  <i>fields</i> or <i>instance variables</i> with the prefix <code>this</code>.</p>

            <pre class="brush: processing; gutter: false; toolbar: false; highlight: [6,8,9,10,11]">// -- Very Basic Robot class that accepts arguments ... now with eyes!
// -- OK - we are getting somewhere!

class RobotMk3 {
  
  float x,y;
  
  RobotMk3 (float x, float y) {
    this.x = x;
    this.y = y;
  }
  
  void draw() {
    // -- draw the head:
    fill(200);
    strokeWeight(1);
    rect(x,y,30,20);

    // -- draw the eyes:
    fill(32);
    circle(x-6,y-2,4);
    circle(x+6,y-2,4);

    // -- draw the mouth:
    line(x-10,y+6, x+10, y+6);
  }
  
}</pre>
            <p>The most important thing here is that the constructor sets the values of the <i>fields</i> or <i>instance variables</i> so that each <i>instance</i> of a class, or <i>object</i>, holds its own data - just as each instantiated variable holds data. This is how we put data in our buckets!</p>
            <p>We could avoid the use of the <code>this</code> prefix by giving our arguments unique names and using them to set the <i>fields</i> or <i>instance variables</i> in the constructor, as shown below.</p>

<pre class="brush: processing; gutter: false; toolbar: false; highlight: [5,6]">// -- Very Basic Robot class that accepts arguments ... now with eyes!
// -- Alternative constructor 

  RobotMk3 (float xInput, float yInput) {
    x = xInput; // &lt;-- set the field (or instance variable) 'x' with the argument that is passed to the RobotMk3 when it is instantiated
    y = yInput; // &lt;-- do the same for 'y'
  }</pre>

  <p>We can <i>declare</i> the Mark 3 Robots as global variables, and <i>instantiate</i> them either as we declare them, as shown below, or in <code>setup()</code>.</p>

  <pre class="brush: processing; gutter: false; toolbar: false;">// -- Declare and instantiate the Robots as globals before the draw() and setup() methods in the sketch:
// -- The names here are just robot names - the numbers don't mean anything, these are not arrays or grouping structures.
// -- But notice that we are passing arguments into the constructor that will be used to fill the fields in each object.
RobotMk3 r2d1 = new RobotMk3(150, 150);
RobotMk3 r2d2 = new RobotMk3(150, 250);
RobotMk3 r2d3 = new RobotMk3(250, 250);
RobotMk3 r2d4 = new RobotMk3(250, 150);</pre>

<p>We then call the <code>draw()</code> method of each of our Robots in the main <code>draw()</code> loop of the sketch to show them on the canvas (if we want to see them ... which we do presumably!).</p>
<pre class="brush: processing; gutter: false; toolbar: false;">// -- This is the draw() loop of the main sketch:
    void draw() {
      background(250);
      // -- Call the draw() methods of the robot objects to show them on the canvas:
      r2d1.draw();
      r2d2.draw();
      r2d3.draw();
      r2d4.draw();
    }</pre>

    </div>

    <h3>6. Mark 4 - A Class with Multiple Arguments and Methods - the 'Something Better' Class</h3>

        <p>It should be clear that we can add more characteristics to our objects and give them more behaviours by adding more arguments to the constructor and more methods to the <code>class</code>.</p>
        <p>The <i>Mark4 Robot</i> is better specified, with four <i>fields</i> that are filled with arguments passed into the class on instantiation and more dynamic - it has a simple <code>move()</code> class.
            The <code>draw()</code> class also adds code that makes the robot <i>blink</i> (<code>circle()</code> or <code>line()</code> for eyes) based upon the current value of <code>frameCount</code>.
            We could add <i>methods</i> to our robot <code>class</code> to make the robot objects make noises, chase other robots, fire lasers ... whatever, and we could add fields to determine blink rate, velocity, movement direction, and various other visual characteristics. We could add more shapes to the <code>draw()</code> method in the <i>RobotMk4</i> class to give the robots a body - legs, wheels, it's basically down to your needs and imagination! </p>
        <p>Here's the more sophisticated <i>RobotMk2</i> <code>class</code>, with four arguments and two methods:</p>
            <pre class="brush: processing; gutter: false; toolbar: false; highlight: [10,11,12,13,14,15,38,39,40,41]">// -- More sophisticated Basic Robot class with multiple arguments (fields, instance variables) ... and methods!

        float wide, high;
    
        // -- Fields have the same names as arguments, so use the 'this' prefix to differentiate:

            this.y = y;

            We can declare and instantiate these <i>Mark4 Robots</i> in the same way that we have done previously, but we need four arguments this time to fill the <code>x</code>, <code>y</code>, <code>wide</code> and <code>high</code> fields of the objects we create.<br/>
            A good way to do this is to declare the robots at the top of the script as globals:    
            </p>
            <pre class="brush: processing; gutter: false; toolbar: false; highlight: [2]">// -- Declare the Mark4 robots as globals at the top of the script: 
  RobotMk4 r2d1, r2d2, r2d3;</pre>

            <p>
                Then instantiate them with data values in <code>setup()</code>.
            </p>

  <pre class="brush: processing; gutter: false; toolbar: false; highlight: [2,3,4]">// -- Instantiate the Mark4 robots - passing 4 arguments that fill their fields:
  r2d1 = new RobotMk4(x,y,wide,high);
  r2d2 = new RobotMk4(200,40,wide,high);

            <p>
                Before calling the <code>draw()</code> and <code>move()</code> methods associated with each instance (object) in the main <code>draw()</code> loop of the sketch to make sure that these behaviours (drawing and moving) happen 60 times per second.
            </p>

  <pre class="brush: processing; gutter: false; toolbar: false; highlight: [5,6,7,8,9,10]">// -- This is the draw() loop of the main sketch:

    r2d1.move();

    r2d3.draw();

          <h3>7. Scope, Mistake, Confusion, Error - Correction!</h3>
          <p>
            When I tried to show all of this in class, despite being a bit rushed, and despite the rush and fear of live coding in front of hundreds of people, things went OK at first. I wanted to show just how <i>easy</i> it is to create classes and use them to include objects usefully in your code.<br/>
            But then I could not get the <i>RobotMk4</i> class to work, and I couldn't see the problem. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Thankfully, one of you did, and helpfully pointed me to the error at the end of the class. Getting fresh eyes, many eyes, experienced eyes, alternative eyes, on your code is extremely valuable.
          </p>
          <p>
            The problem was a classic error - one that we ask you to be careful not to make.<br/>
            I declared the robots as <i>global</i> variables, making them accessible in <code>setup()</code> and <code>draw()</code>.<br/>
            But then, when I instantiated them in <code>setup()</code> I also <i>declared</i> them again, meaning that I had in fact created two new robot objects with the same name as my globals that were only accessible in <code>setup()</code>.<br/>
            This meant that when I tried to access the global robots in <code>draw()</code> to draw them, <i>Processing</i> was unable to complete the request as the global variables that were the only robots known to <code>draw()</code> had not been instantiated!
          </p>
          <p>
            The error <span style="font-weight:normal; padding:4px; padding-left:1em; padding-right:1em; background-color:rgb(220,32,32); color:#fff; font-size:90%">NullPointerException</span> was not particularly helpful, so I (and perhaps you) need to remember that this can mean:</p>
            <blockquote>You are trying to use objects that have not been instantiated - perhaps you have a problem with variable scope!</blockquote>

            <p>You can replicate the error in the above example by replacing ...</p>

          <pre class="brush: processing; gutter: false; toolbar: false; highlight: [2,3,4]">// -- Instantiate the Mark4 robots - passing 4 arguments that fill their fields:

    r2d3 = new RobotMk4(280,60,wide,high);</pre>
    <p>... with the following, which rather than instantiating the existing <code>RobotMk4</code> objects that have been declared as globals, creates new local <code>RobotMk4</code> objects (with the same names as the existing globals) that are only accessible in <code>setup()</code>, and never used ...</p>

            <p>Thanks for pointing this out!<br/>
                We all make multiple errors in our programs and scripts as we write them, and working our how to react to them is absolutely key in our efforts to successful coding, and learning how to code.<br/>
                Enjoy making and creating with <code>classes</code>, enjoy learning from your errors, thank those who help you out and enjoy your robots!</p>
