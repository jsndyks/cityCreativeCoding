        <p class="intro">
            This project involves generating graphical barcodes that store small amounts of data. These can be read by
            most mobile phones' cameras as well as dedicated barcode readers.
        </p>

        <p>
            The barcodes that appear on most packaged items for purchase are capable of storing 11 numbers. In this
            project you will write your own barcode generator using the common <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Product_Code#Numbering" target="_blank">UPC-A</a>
            standard. Most modern mobile phones will have the ability to read UPC barcodes via their camera, but you may
            wish to check your phone can by pointing your camera at the following:
        </p>

        <div><img src="https://staff.city.ac.uk/~jwo/bootcamp2021/images/barcode/barcodeTest.png" width="400"
                height="196" alt="Test barcode" /></div>

        <p>
            It should pick up the number <b><code>202110040000</code></b>. If it does, you are good go with writing your
            own barcode generator!
        </p>

        <p>
            A bar code is made up of a collection of <i>modules</i> of a fixed width that can be either black or white.
            The modules are grouped together in blocks as indicated in the figure below (the gaps between each block are
            to make the diagram clearer; in reality all modules are adjacent):
        </p>

        <div><img src="https://staff.city.ac.uk/~jwo/bootcamp2021/images/barcode/barEncoding.png" width="1004"
                height="292" alt="Bar encoding structure" /><br /><br />
        </div>

        <p>
            Reading from left to right the barcode starts with 9 white modules followed by a set of 3 indicating the
            start of the bar. The start will always be black-white-black. The first 6 digits to be stored are then each
            represented by 6 blocks of 7 modules (see below for how each digit is represented). The middle of the bar
            code is always represented by a sequence of 5: white-black-white-black-white. This is followed by another 6
            digits, the last of which is a special 'check digit'. Finally the bar is terminated by a special end
            sequence black-white-black and another 9 module quiet zone.
        </p>

        <p>The fact that the marker blocks are longer than the digit blocks is just to aid human reading of the bar
            code. There is no need to vary the length of the lines in order for a scanner to read the code.
        </p>

        <h2>Encoding Digits</h2>

        <p>Each of the 12 digits that make up the data stored by the barcode is encoded with a block of 7 modules. The
            first 6 use 'left encoding' as shown in the figure below. The second 6 use 'right encoding'. For example if
            the first digit was a 6, it would be represented by white-black-white-black-black-black-black stripes. If
            the eighth digit was also a 6, it would be represented by black-white-black-white-white-white-white stripes.
        </p>

        <p>
            Thinking about how items might be scanned in a shop, why do you think there are separate 'left' and 'right'
            encodings? What is the relationship between a left- and right-encoding of a given digit? Try counting up the
            number of black stipes in each encoding to give you a clue for why this is the case.
        </p>

        </div>

        <h3>The Check Digit</h3>

        <p>A barcode can store data comprising 11 digits, but as you can see, the encoding itself has space for 12.
            That 12th digit is a special 'check digit' and is used to ensure there are no mistakes in printing or
            reading the barcode. It is calculated from the first 11 digits as follows:
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li>Add the digits at odd-numbered positions (1st, 3rd, 5th etc.) and multiply by 3</li>
            <li>Add the digits at even-numbered positions (2nd, 4th, 6th etc.) to the result.</li>
            <li>Calculate the sum's <a href="https://processing.org/reference/modulo.html" target="_blank">modulo</a>
                base 10 (i.e. the last digit of this sum) and call it <i>m</i>.</li>
            <li>If <i>m</i> is zero, then the check digit is <code>0</code>; otherwise the check digit is
                <code>10 âˆ’ m</code>.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Project Ideas</h2>
        <p>The above information should be enough for you to create your own barcode writer in Processing. You can draw
            lines with Processing's <a href="https://processing.org/reference/line_.html" target="_blank">line()</a>
            method and you can control the colour of the line with <a
                href="https://processing.org/reference/stroke_.html" target="_blank">stroke()</a>. You should be able to
            create your own method that when given an 11 digit number (best represented as an array of 11
            <code>Strings</code>or <code>chars</code>), it draws the relevant sequence of black and white lines as
            detailed above. You can test whether your writer works by using your phone's camera.
        </p>

        <p>
            Here are some further variations and extensions you might want to consider, but feel free to think up your
            own:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Convert your date of birth into a number and then a barcode</li>
            <li>Can you draw several bar codes for representing multiple numbers?</li>
            <li>Can you encode some short text by storing its <a href="https://www.asciitable.com"
                    target="_blank">ASCII</a> numbers? <i>Hint:</i> you can convert the letter A into its ASCII number
                with <a href="https://processing.org/reference/intconvert_.html" target="_blank">int('A')</a> and you
                can convert a number 65 back into a letter with <a
                    href="https://processing.org/reference/charconvert_.html" target="_blank">char(65)</a>. The
                uppercase letters A-Z and the space character all require two digits each.</li>
            <li>Can you use Processing to hide a bar code in a larger picture (probably one with some other stripes
                in it) so that it is not visible to a person, but your camera is still able to read it? Note that bar
                code readers do not require the bars to be vertical. This form of hidden encoding is known as <a
                    href="https://moodle.city.ac.uk/mod/page/view.php?id=2058808" target="_blank">steganography</a>.
            </li>
            <li>Could you produce a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_code" target="_blank">QR-code</a>
                generator for storing larger volumes of text?</li>

        </ul>
