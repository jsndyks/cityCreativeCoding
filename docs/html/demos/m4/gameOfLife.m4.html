        <p class="intro">
            Long before Minecraft there was John Conway's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life"
                target="_blank"> Game of Life</a>. This was an early example of what are known as <i>cellular
                automata</i> - simple rules applied to cells in a grid that can lead to complex patterns of behaviour.
        </p>

        <p>
            <i>Cells</i> are arranged in a simple grid and simple rules are applied to each of these cells that have the
            potential to change the state of the cell. A cell can have one of two states: it is either <i>alive</i> or
            <i>dead</i>. If it is alive it is shown as a black square, if it is dead it is not drawn. Each cell is
            compared with its eight neighbours in order to determine its new state. The rules applied in Conway's
            original Game of Life were as follows:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>If a living cell has fewer than two neighbours it will die ('<i>underpopulation</i>').</li>
            <li>If a living cell has more than three neighbours it will die ('<i>overpopulation</i>').</li>
            <li>If a dead cell has exactly three neighbours it will be replaced with a new living cell ('<i>birth</i>').
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            In all other cases, the state of the cell remains unaffected (e.g. a dead cell with two neighbours remains
            dead; a living cell with two neighbours remains alive). The application of these rules over two iterations
            is shown for a simple configuration below:
        </p>



        <img src="https://staff.city.ac.uk/~jwo/bootcamp2018/images/life/lifeSimple.png" height="271"
            alt="Game of Life: Simple iterations"><br>
        <br><br>

        <p>
            At time t=0, cell <b>e</b> with neighbours <b>a</b>, <b>b</b>, <b>c</b>, <b>d</b>, <b>f</b>, <b>g</b>,
            <b>h</b> and <b>i</b> has exactly three living neighbours (cells <b>c</b>, <b>f</b> and <b>h</b>), so it
            will remain alive at time t=1. Dead cell <b>b</b> also has three neighbours (<b>c</b>, <b>e</b> and
            <b>f</b>) so 'gives birth' and becomes alive at time t=1. Likewise for cell <b>i</b> (with three living
            neighbours <b>e</b>, <b>f</b> and <b>h</b>). If the same rules are applied at time t=1, cells <b>e</b> and
            <b>f</b> will both die through overpopulation (they both have five living neighbours). The result in this
            example is the stable configuration shown at t=2 known as a 'beehive'.
        </p>

        <p>
            By applying these simple rules <i>iteratively</i> to various starting configurations, a number of
            interesting patterns can be seen to develop. Some will <i>oscillate</i> between states, some, like 'gliders'
            will appear to move across the grid, while others stabilise as a 'still life'.
        </p>

            By changing the way cells is displayed, it is possible to produce some visually interesting representations,
            for example by colouring each live cell by its location and age, or by showing cells as 3D blocks.

        <p>
            There are many, many ways in which you could use cellular automata, but here are some possible project ideas
            to get you thinking:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Using the the standard game of life rules, try experimenting with different visual representations such
                as circles, instead of squares. Try relating the size, colour or other appearance to characteristics of
                the cell such as its age or location.</li>
            <li>Experiment with different sets of rules that determine if a cell lives or dies. Can you find any stable
                rules?</li>
            <li>Use interaction to add or remove cells. Could you allow the addition of 'preset' shapes such as <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glider_(Conway%27s_Life)" target="_blank">gliders</a>, or <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methuselah_(cellular_automaton)"
                    target="_blank">Methuselahs</a>.</li>
            <li>Cells don't have to have 8 neighbours (i.e. square). What would hex-life look like? Or even cells with
                more neighbours than could be drawn on a plane?</li>
            <li>3d life? Could you create a minecraft-like environment to show the life cells? Could you create new 3d
                rules for cell generation?</li>
        </ul>
