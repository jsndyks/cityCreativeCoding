    <p class="intro">
        This project involves generating hidden messages through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steganography" target="_blank" ?="">steganography</a>. That is, the art
        of concealing some text or image in plain sight.
    </p>

    <p>
        If you want to send a secret message to someone you can encrypt it with some kind of code or cypher. But one
        of the problems with encryption is that it is usually obvious that a message has been encrypted and so can
        attract attention of others wanting to decrypt it. Alternatively you can hide a message in such a way that
        no one but the intended recipient of the message even knows there is a message to find. Hiding such messages
        is known as steganography.
    </p>

    <p>
        For this project, you can think creatively about how you might use Processing to create some digital object
        such as some text, an image or some sound that hides within it some other message. Here are a couple of
        examples to consider, but you may be able to come up with others.
    </p>

    <h2>Text Steganography</h2>
    <p>
        In the Data Visualization session you learned how to read a text file into Processing. You could read a
        large text such as <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/36/36-0.txt" target="_blank">War of the
            Worlds</a> from Project Gutenberg and select sentences from it to hide a message of your choice. For
        example, look at the last word of each sentence in the middle paragraph below to uncover a hidden message.
    </p>

    <pre>“Now as I stood and examined it, finding a pleasure in the mere touch
of the contrivance, the thing I had expected happened. The bronze
panels suddenly slid up and struck the frame with a clang. I was in the
dark—trapped. So the Morlocks thought. At that I chuckled gleefully.

“I feel assured it’s this business of the Time Machine,” I said, and
took up the Psychologist’s account of our previous <b>meeting</b>. “It sounds
plausible enough tonight,” said the Medical Man; “but wait until <b>tomorrow</b>. 
I can’t argue this <b>night</b>”. I looked  into the thickness of the wood and 
thought of what it might <b>hide</b>. There were numbers of guns, pistols, and 
<b>rifles</b>. I felt assured that the Time Machine was  only to be recovered
by boldly penetrating these mysteries of <b>underground</b>.

“I could already hear their murmuring laughter as they came towards me.
Very calmly I tried to strike the match. I had only to fix on the
levers and depart then like a ghost. But I had overlooked one little
thing. The matches were of that abominable kind that light only on the
box.</pre>

    <p>
        You should be able to use Processing's <a href="https://processing.org/reference/String.html" target="_blank">String methods</a> such as <a href="https://processing.org/reference/split_.html" target="_blank">split()</a> and <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/String.html#startsWith(java.lang.String)">startsWith()</a>
        to extract and search for words in the text. This should allow you to select parts of the text that contain
        words of your choice.
    </p>


    <h2>Image Steganography</h2>
    <p>
        Can you tell the difference between these two rectangles?
    </p>

    <div><img src="images/steganography/colourDiff.png" width="300" height="150" alt="Two oranges"></div>

    <p>
        Although they look the same, the first is coloured with <code>fill(200, 100, 50)</code> and the second with
        <code>fill(201, 99, 51)</code>. We can use such small differences in colour value to hide other information.
        The data are stored digitally, but we cannot perceive the hidden data in the image pixel colours.
    </p>

    <p>We can even store entire hidden images. The image below left contains a hidden image by varying the
        transparency of each image pixel between 240 and 255 – allowing 16 levels of grey to be stored in each pixel
        undetected. Because the transparency does not vary very much (between 240 and 255) it is not detectable when
        viewing casually. Yet if you extract those transparency values (using <a href="https://processing.org/reference/alpha_.html" target="_blank">alpha()</a>) and use them to
        determine a grey level between 0-255, you get the image below right.</p>

    <table>
        <tbody><tr>
            <td><img src="images/steganography/imageSteg1.png" width="300" height="400" alt="Public image"></td>
            <td><img src="images/steganography/imageSteg2.png" width="300" height="400" alt="Hidden image"></td>
        </tr>
    </tbody></table>

    <p>
        For your project you could create a sketch that will hide one image inside another using the least important
        parts of pixel colour values so they are undetectable when displayed. You can then write an 'image decoder'
        that extracts and displays the hidden image. Here are a few hints to help you get started:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Make sure you have read through the Image Processing bootcamp lecture and have had some practice at
            manipulating images.</li>
        <li>You can load images from files with <a href="https://processing.org/reference/loadImage_.html" target="_blank">loadImage()</a></li>
        <li>You can create new images in processing with <a href="https://processing.org/reference/createImage_.html" target="_blank">createImage()</a> and you
            can set a new image to be the same dimensions as an existing one with
            <code>PImage newImg = createImage(oldImg.width, oldImg.height, ARGB);</code>
        </li>
        <li>If you wish to read the pixel values of an image you must fist call <a href="https://processing.org/reference/loadPixels_.html" target="_blank">loadPixels()</a> before you
            use the <a href="https://processing.org/reference/pixels.html" target="_blank">pixels</a> array.</li>
        <li>If you wish to change the pixel values of an image you must call <a href="https://processing.org/reference/updatePixels_.html" target="_blank">updatePixels()</a> after
            you have changed the image's <a href="https://processing.org/reference/pixels.html" target="_blank">pixels</a> array.</li>
        <li>You can extract the red, green, blue, brightness and transparency values of a pixel with <a href="https://processing.org/reference/red_.html" target="_blank">red()</a>, <a href="https://processing.org/reference/green_.html" target="_blank">green()</a>, <a href="https://processing.org/reference/blue_.html" target="_blank">blue()</a>, <a href="https://processing.org/reference/brightness_.html" target="_blank">brightness()</a> and <a href="https://processing.org/reference/alpha_.html" target="_blank">alpha()</a> respectively.</li>
        <li>You can set the <i>i</i>th pixel value in the <a href="https://processing.org/reference/pixels.html" target="_blank">pixels</a> array with <code>pixels[i] = color(XXX)</code> where <code>XXX</code> is
            any colour description such as <code>(200,100,50).</code></li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        To make this project more fun you might wish to find a partner and give each other a steganographic object
        (text or image) and challenge each other to try to find the secret data embedded within it. This will give
        you practice at both encoding and decoding messages.
