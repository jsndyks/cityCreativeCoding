        <p class="intro">
            This project involves using Processing to generate tiled patterns, or <i>tessellations</i>. Tiles can be
            easily generated with Processing since it involves using loops to repeatedly draw simple shapes. By varying
            the shape drawn and the colours used to fill the shapes, attractive patterns can be produced.
        </p>

        <p>
            Tessellations are space-filling shapes that fit together to form sometimes intricate patterns. There is a
            huge variety of possible tessellations and this project involves you getting creative with Processing to
            produce some visually pleasing tiling patterns. For inspiration you might like to try doing a Google image
            search for <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=image:tessellated+tiling&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch"
                target="_blank">tessellated tiling</a>
        </p>


        <h3>Square Grids</h3>

        <p>
            A simple way of starting would be to create a regular grid of square tiles. You might chose to colour these
            in interesting ways. To create a regular grid in Processing, you can use nested <code>for</code> loops - one
            counting through the rows in your grid, the other inside it counting through the columns.
        </p>

        <p>
            You can add further interest by adding a small random variation to each corner or <i>vertex</i> of the shape
            you are drawing. While strictly not a tessellation (because it can lead to gaps and overlaps), it can
            produce a visually pleasing effect.
            <br /><br />

        </p>

        <p>
            Interesting patterns can be generated even from the most basic of shapes. For example, by randomly choosing
            between four orientations of square tiles made up of two triangles each, a so-called <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truchet_tiling" target="_blank">Truchet tiling</a> can be generated.
        </p>

                height="152" alt="four triangular tiles"><br> A random choice can be made from these four tiles to
            produce tessellation similar to the following:
            <br /><br />
            <img src="https://staff.city.ac.uk/~jwo/bootcamp2018/images/tessellation/tessellation3.png" width="1000"
                height="300" alt="Simple triangular tiling with random orientation"><br>
        </p>

        <p>
            Think about what other shapes you might choose to draw. For example, by replacing the four triangular tiles
            with two tiles composed of simple arcs of circles (generated in Processing with the <a
                href="https://processing.org/reference/arc_.html" target="_blank">arc()</a> method) a curved maze effect
            can be created.
        </p>

                height="300" alt="Truchet tiling with random orientation"><br>
        </p>

        <p>
            Using fill colours for the quarter circles gives rise to four combinations from which solid maze-like paths
            can be created.

        </p>

        <h3>Hexagonal Grids</h3>

        <p>
            You can consider further possibilities by arranging shapes on a hexagonal rather than square grid. The
            principle is much the same in that you will also need to use nested loops to iterate through the rows and
            columns of the grid. The only difference is that every other row is slightly offset from the row above and
            below it.
        </p>

        <p>
            It is often useful, before you start coding, to sketch out your design on paper first. So for example, to
            create a cube-like tessellation based on a hexagonal grid, you might end up sketching something like the
            following.
            <br /><br />
            <img src="https://staff.city.ac.uk/~jwo/bootcamp2018/images/tessellation/tessellation8.png" width="312"
                height="263" alt="Construction of a cube tesseral cell"><br>
        </p>

        <p>
            This cube shape is built up by drawing a diamond shape (using Processing's <a
                href="https://processing.org/reference/quad_.html" target="_blank">quad()</a> method.) and then rotating
            the diamond clockwise by 120 degrees to give the yellow right face, then another 120 degrees to give the red
            left face. You will probably find it easiest to put the code to draw a single tile (like this cube) in its
            own method so you can call it multiple times from inside your nested <code>for</code> loops. This also makes
            it easier to modify your tile to produce different visual effects.
        </p>

                height="300" alt="Hollow cube tessellation"><br />
            Tessellation of hexagon shapes with addition of two triangles per face to suggest hollow cubes.
        </p>

                height="300" alt="Randomised hollow cube tessellation"><br />
            Tessellation of hollow cubes with random colouring and small random variation in the positioning of
            vertices.
        </p>

        <p>
            For this project, you can design your own choice of tiles and colouring. Some possible variations include
            those below, but you are encouraged also to come up with your own ideas.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Introduce some random colouring in your tiles. Think about your colour choice to enhance the appearance
                of the tessellation.</li>
            <li>Introduce a random choice of different tiles and see the effect of combining them.</li>
            <li>How might you use interaction (from the mouse or keyboard) to influence the sketch?</li>
            <li>Consider animating your tessellation, for example by gradually changing the size or orientation of the
                tiles.</li>
        </ul>
