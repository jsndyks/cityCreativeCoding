        <p class="intro">
            Drawing coloured balls on screen is easy with Processing. Making those balls move and interact with their
            environment is a little more challenging, but the code to do this can be simplified by creating a <a
                href="https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/mod/page/view.php?id=466630" target="_new">simple Ball class</a>. In this project you
            will develop a simple game that uses a Ball class as basis for your design.
        </p>

        <p>
            Firstly, make sure you have read the page on <a
                href="https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/mod/page/view.php?id=466630" target="_new">developing a simple Ball class</a>. That
            page took you as far as allowing the balls to bounce off each other within your sketch. Think about how you
            might add some further interaction (both between balls as well as the 'player' of the game). For example you
            might make some balls 'eat' others that they bump in to. You might allow one ball controllable with the
            mouse and the objective of the game might be to avoid the carnivorous balls.
        </p>

        <p>
            There are plenty of possibilities for developing the bouncing ball sketch into something more interesting.
            For some inspiration have a look at the game <a href="https://www.osmos-game.com" target="_blank">Osmos</a>.
            You don't have to recreate this game, but it is an example of how adding relatively simple rules to the
            balls (when two collide, the larger one eats the smaller one and grows a little) can make things
            interesting.
        </p>

        <p>
            Here are some possible rules to add to your ball sketch (but feel free to ignore these or add your own):
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>When two balls collide, the larger one eats the smaller and grows by the size of the eaten one</li>
            <li>The larger the ball is, the more slowly it moves</li>
            <li>When two balls of the same colour collide they merge; when balls of a different colour collide they
                bounce</li>
            <li>Balls shrink slowly unless they come into contact with 'food'</li>
        </ul>
