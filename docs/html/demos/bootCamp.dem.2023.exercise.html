Explore the various demo ideas and use your _Processing_ skills, _creativity_ and _imagination_ to develop a sketch that you can explain, the does something that you could not do at the start of BootCamp.

You can access [this page](https://jsndyks.github.io/cityBootCamp/html/decisions/bootCamp.dem.2023.exercise.html) outside of _Moodle_ should you wish to do so.

        <p>
            These exercises are designed to help you get creative with your coding design and project choice. They
            should help you see the possibilities for exciting and original sketches.
        </p>


        <div class="codeTask">
            1. Choose any of the sketches you have worked on this week and save a copy in a folder
            '<code>projectIdeas</code>'.
            <br /><br />
            Try modifying with the sketch so that it does something slightly different. This might involve changing the
            colours or shapes shown, or the number of features in the sketch, or how it responds to mouse movement or
            key presses. How you modify the sketch is up to you. Try to get creative, and don't forget to have fun!
            <br /><br />
            Show your modified sketch to someone else in your lab class and ask them to make suggestions about how you
            might modify it further. Can you make the changes they suggest? Does it give you ideas about how you might
            change the sketch in a new direction?
        </div>
        <br /><br />

        <div class="codeTask">
            2. Browse Processing's <a href="https://processing.org/examples/" target="_blank">Examples pages</a>. Copy
            one of the examples from those pages and try modifying it, just as you did for the previous task. Does this
            suggest new possibilities for your own project?
        </div>
        <br /><br />


        <div class="challenge">
            3. Are there any libraries there that might help you use Processing to create an interesting project? By
            following the documentation / tutorials for a library of your choice, develop a simple sketch that makes use
            of one of these libraries.
        </div>
        <br /><br />

        <br /><br />
        <div class="homework">
            4. In your own time, watch the <i>Hello World! Processing</i> documentary.
            <br /><br />
            <span class="mediaplugin mediaplugin_vimeo">
                <iframe title="Hello World! Processing" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/60735314" width="400"
                    height="300" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen=""
                    allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
            </span>
            <br /><br />
            Does this give you any ideas for your own projects?<br/>Remember that successful coding is about creativity as
            well as logical and structured thought.
