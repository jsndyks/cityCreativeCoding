        <p class="intro">
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_art" target="_blank">Generative art</a> involves
            constructing artwork from sets of relatively simple rules that allow the work to build itself as a computer
            program is run. Agent-based generative art places those rules inside many <i>agents</i> that interact with
            their environment to produce visual patterns.
        </p>

        <p>
            For generative art projects you will create one or more <i>classes</i> to contain simple rules for
            describing an agent's behaviour. For examples, have a look at the <a
                href="https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/mod/page/view.php?id=466630" target="_new">bouncing ball</a> and <a
                href="https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/mod/page/view.php?id=464458" target="_new">randomness</a> pages to see how classes
            can be created and used to control the visual appearance of a sketch.
        </p>

        <p>
            As a general guide, start by creating a simple class representing an agent. It is likely that as a minimum,
            your agent will contain two variables representing its screen position (<code>x</code> and <code>y</code>)
            as well as some rules that change its location. Next create a simple sketch that draws on the screen using
            this single agent. Then try adding several agents by creating an array of them. You should experiment with
            changes to both the visual appearance of your drawing (colour, line and fill styles etc.) as well as the
            rules that define your agent's behaviour.
        </p>

        <p>
            How you design your agent is up to you. The key is to experiment to come up with something you like. If you
            are stuck for ideas, here are a few to get you started:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Create agents that respond to movement of the mouse. Allow them to leave 'trails' so they build up your
                picture as they move around.</li>
            <li>Use your agents to provide the vertices of some simple shapes (e.g. three agents could represent the
                three corners of a triangle).</li>
            <li>Create agents that interact with each other in some way (see the <a
                    href="https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/mod/page/view.php?id=464458" target="_new">bouncing ball</a> page for an
                example).</li>
            <li>Create agents that have rules for changing their size and colour as well as position. Experiment with
                different visual appearances.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Even small changes to an agent's behaviour can have a big effect on the visual appearance of a sketch.
            Below are the results of minor changes to the <a
                href="https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/mod/page/view.php?id=464458#generative" target="_blank">random Perlin
                noise sketch</a>. The different images were produced using the same agent code but altering
            characteristics like line thickness, number of agents and Perlin distance.
