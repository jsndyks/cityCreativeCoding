                </div>

                <p>
                    When coding you have come to rely on the fact that instructions are usually executed in the order
                    you provide them in your code. Within a method such as <code>setup()</code>, <code>draw()</code> or
                    the ones you create yourself, program flow moves from top to bottom one instruction at a time.
                </p>


                <p>
                    We have seen how we can modify this rule slightly by providing <i>conditional blocks</i> of code
                    that are only executed if a particular condition is met. If it is not met, than the block of code is
                    skipped. Even so, this still follows the general rule of code execution moving from 'top to bottom'
                    within any one method.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We have also seen how we can move whole blocks of code into their own methods and call those methods
                    at any time. This has allowed us to make repeated calls to a single block of code. Even though the
                    use of methods makes program flow a little more complex, within any one method, we still follow the
                    rule of moving 'downward' though each line of code from the top to the bottom of the method.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We can modify program flow further through the creation of <i>loops</i>. These are blocks of code
                    that are repeated time after time — when program execution gets to the end of the loop it returns
                    back to the start of the loop before repeating.
                </p>

                <p>
                    A loop is simply a block of code that is repeated a certain number of times. It will usually apply
                    some form of test to check whether it should repeat or not. This allows the loop to be repeated a
                    fixed number of times. Repeating some code in a programming language is known as <i>iteration</i>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    You have already taken advantage of one kind of loop — the <code>draw()</code> loop, which executes
                    all the code inside <code>draw()</code> repeatedly, at a rate of 60 times every second.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In addition to repeating the whole of <code>draw()</code> we can make smaller blocks of code repeat
                    by creating our own loops. These are very useful when we know we have to get the computer to do
                    something many times and we want to save ourselves the bother of coding each instruction multiple
                    times.
                </p>

                <p>
                    For example, suppose we wished to draw nine squares in a line:
                    <br />
                    <img src="https://staff.city.ac.uk/~jwo/bootcamp2018/lecture05/images/rectangles.png" width="960"
                        height="110" alt="9 rectangles">
                    <br />
                    One approach might be to issue the <code>rect()</code> command, once for each square. Something like
                    this:
                </p>
                <pre class="brush: processing; gutter: false; toolbar: false; ">    rect( 40,50,80,80);
    rect(140,50,80,80);
    rect(240,50,80,80);
    rect(340,50,80,80);
    rect(440,50,80,80);
    rect(540,50,80,80);
    rect(640,50,80,80);
    rect(740,60,80,80);
    rect(840,50,80,80);</pre>

                <p>
                    As well as being a little tedious to type, repeating code like this makes it unnecessarily
                    complicated to edit (e.g. suppose we wished to change the size of each square) as well as
                    error-prone (did you spot the mistake in line 8?). Instead of writing the same commands or lines of
                    code many times, loops allow us to write the code once, placing it inside a structure that requests the
                    code be repeated many times.
                </p>

                <div class="tip">
                    <h5>Tip:</h5>
                    If you find yourself writing very similar code many times, the chances are that it can be improved
                    in both efficiency and clarity by using a loop to bring out the regularity. One of the skills in
                    programming is in being able to recognise that a particular task can be broken down into a repeated
                    set of simpler tasks.

                <h3>2. The <code>for</code> loop</h3>
                <p>
                    One of the commonest forms of loops in <i>Processing</i> (and other languages) is the <code>for</code> loop.
                    The example below shows how it might be used to draw those nine squares:
                </p>

                <pre class="brush: processing; gutter: false; toolbar: false; ">for (int i=0; i&lt;9; i=i+1)
{
  rect(40 + i*100, 50, 80,80);
}
</pre>

                <p>
                    A for loop has two parts — a <i>header</i> and a <i>body</i>. The body is the block of code between
                    the curly braces: this is the code that will be repeated. The header is the line beginning with
                    <code>for</code> and comprising three elements each separated by a semicolon. Those three elements are:
                </p>

                <ol>
                    <li><p>A <b>loop counter declaration and initialisation</b>. In the example above it is the code
                        <code>int i=0;</code>. This declaration is just like any other variable declaration in that we
                        say what type of variable is being declared (the <code>int</code> type in this example) and we
                        give it a name.</p><p>It is common to give loop counters short names such as <code>i</code>, but you
                        are free to give more explanatory names if you wish such as <code>counter</code>. That counter
                        variable is only useable within the loop itself.</p>
                    </li>

                    <li><p>A <b>conditional test</b>. This is the test that is carried out every time the loop repeats, and
                        only if the result of the test is <code>true</code> will the body of the loop be executed. By
                        allowing the result of the test to sometimes be <code>false</code> we can get the loop to repeat
                        only a fixed number of times.</p><p>In our example above the conditional test is <code>i&lt;9;</code>.
                        In other words, the loop code will only be executed if the loop counter <code>i</code> is less
                        than 9.</p>
                    </li>

                    <li><p>A <b>loop counter assignment</b> that applies some update to the loop counter. Typically this is
                        to increase the value of the counter by one on each repeat. This is necessary otherwise the
                        conditional test would never allow the loop to finish.</p><p>In our example this element is
                        <code>i=i+1</code> but in principle it could be any form of assignment such as decreasing the
                        counter by one or increasing it by 10.</p>
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <p>
                    The rules of variable declaration and scope also apply to loops. Variables <i>declared</i> in the
                    header or within the braces of a loop are only usable within the loop itself.
                </p>

                <p>
                    A couple of other things to note when using for loops. The header line has no semicolon at the end.
                    This is consistent with the coding of methods and conditional (<code>if</code>) blocks in that the
                    semicolon is replaced with an open and close brace. It is only within the block of code inside the
                    braces that the lines will have semicolons.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The code inside the braces of the loop should be indented. Again this is consistent with the way we
                    have used indentation with braces when writing code in a method. Use CTRL-T (PC) or CMD-T (Mac) to make your indentation consistent - very useful, very important.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Notice also that in our example, we have used the loop counter variable <code>i</code> as part of
                    the <code>rect()</code> command. This allows us to position each rectangle at a different
                    x-coordinate every time the loop is repeated (0, 100, 200, 300 etc.).
                    Most loops will use the counter to affect the instructions that are executed each time the loop draws. 
                </p>

                <div class="codeTask">
                    <h5>Nine Squares</h5>
                    <p>Taking the example <code>for</code> loop code above, put this in a sketch to draw the nine squares.</p>
                    <p>You will need to set the sketch's size to be large enough to show all nine of them, and you may wish to set a
                    <code>fill()</code> colour for the rectangles.</p>
                    <p>Within the loop body, add a <code>println()</code> statement to display the value of <code>i</code>
                    on each iteration of the loop.<br/>Is it what you expected?</p>
                    <p>Use <code>text(i, 40 + i*100, 50)</code> to add the text to the canvas. <br/>
                        You may need to change the <code>fill()</code> colour before displaying the text in order to see it on top of the canvas.</p>
                </div>

                <p>
                    Any code can go inside the body of a loop. For example, here is a modification to the woodland
                    sketch we have previously developed, this time using a for loop to draw many trees.

                <p>
                    Let's return to a simple for loop that displays a row of shapes:
                </p>

                <pre class="brush: processing; gutter: false; toolbar: false;">for (int col=0; col&lt;10; col = col+1)
{
  circle(20 + col*40,height/2, 30);

                </div>

                <p>As we have seen, the loop allows us to code the <code>circle()</code> command only once, but for it
                    to be called 10 times as the loop repeats.</p>
                <p>We can think of all four lines of code comprising the
                    entire loop as a single activity that draws a row of circles.

                <p>
                    Just as we placed the <code>circle()</code> command inside a loop, we can do the same thing for our
                    row drawing code.</p>
                    <p>In other words, we <i>nest</i> one loop inside another. This allows us to draw
                    many rows of circles:
                </p>
                <pre class="brush: processing; gutter: false; toolbar: false;">  for (int row=0; row&lt;10; row = row+1)
  {  // &lt-- commands issued in these braces happen 10 times 
  
    for (int col=0; col&lt;10; col = col+1)
    { // &lt-- commands issued in these braces happen 100 times
        circle(20 + col*40, 20 + row*40, 30);
    }
  }</pre>

                <p>
                    It is important to note that just because we have two loops in the code above doesn't mean we are
                    only repeating something twice. Because we have placed the inner loop <i>inside</i> the body of the
                    outer loop, the <code>code()</code> command is called 10 x 10 = 100 times.<br/>Note how the
                    indentation helps us to recognise this nested structure.
                </p>

                <p>
                    When you nest loops inside other loops or blocks of code, indentation becomes increasingly helpful
                    as a way of making your code clearer to read. You can get <i>Processing</i> to apply that indentation
                    automatically at any time by pressing <code>Control-T</code> (or <code>Cmd-T</code> on a Mac).
                </p>

                <p>
                    Nested loops are very useful when we deal with gridded structures and layouts.

                    If you haven't done so already, create a simple sketch to draw the nine squares from the lecture notes
                    using a single <code>for</code> loop rather than nine separate calls to the <code>rect()</code> method.

                    <p>
                    Within the loop body, add a <code>println()</code> statement to display the value of the loop counter
                    variable on each iteration of the loop. Is it what you expected?

                    <p>
                    If you haven't already, try to change the for loop to produce the following effects (discussed during the
                    lecture):</p>

                        <li>create more or fewer rectangles;</li>
                        <li>draw them towards the left or towards the right of the sketch;</li>
                        <li>space them further apart or closer together;</li>
                        <li>make them increasingly larger in size;</li>
                        <li>make every alternate rectangle red.</li>

                        While program flow is dominantly from top-to-bottom, we have seen how we can force flow to
                        repeat sections of code using loops.

                    <li>
                        A <code>for</code> loop declares, initialises a loop counter, performs a conditional test on the counter to
                        determine whether it should repeat and changes the value of the counter on each <i>iteration</i> of
                        the loop.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Loops can be <i>nested</i> inside one another to provide a convenient way of handling gridded
                        structures.
