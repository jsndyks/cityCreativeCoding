            <p>You need to know under which license you are operating and ensure that you comply with its terms.</p>

            <h2>Sources</h2>

            <p>Many sites that provide media and allow you to search for it give you facilities for specifying usage rights in the search. Most also make it clear how accreditation is to be given.
            We do not specifically recommend either of the following sites, but have used them successfully to find imagery and use it in our applications under appropriate licenses.
            </p>
          
            <h4>Google Image Search</h4>
            <p>Google's image search has an option under <span class="menu">Tools</span> that enables you to search by <span class="menu">Usage Rights</span>. Selecting <span class="menu">Creative Commons licenses</span> should give you options that you can use in your work.</p>
            <p>If you visit the image page, you will find licensing details.</p>
            <p>I found <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Graceful_fox_in_a_rocky_forest_(Unsplash).jpg">this image of a fox</a> using Google's image search tool, with a <em>Creative Commons</em> filter ...</p>
            <div style="padding:1em;padding-left:4em"><img width=300 src="https://jsndyks.github.io/cityBootCamp/images/Graceful_fox_in_a_rocky_forest_(Unsplash).jpg"/></div>
            <p>It has been made available under a <b>CC 0</b> license, meaning that the author waives all rights and does not need to be acknowledged. So, I can use it without acknowledgment as I have done above.</p>
            <blockquote>
              <b>CC 0</b><br/>
              The person who associated a work with this deed has dedicated the work to the public domain by waiving all of their rights to the work worldwide under copyright law, including all related and neighboring rights, to the extent allowed by law. You can copy, modify, distribute and perform the work, even for commercial purposes, all without asking permission. 
            </blockquote>

            <p>However, as a responsible computer scientist, and information professional, I would recommend making the source and licensing as clear as possible, along with the author if known. So I strongly suggest suggest that the professional way to do this, and the way to impress your readers, and be fair to the producers of the information, is by using the image with an explicit acknowledment:</p>

            <div style="padding:1em;padding-left:4em"><img width=300 src="https://jsndyks.github.io/cityBootCamp/images/Graceful_fox_in_a_rocky_forest_(Unsplash).jpg"/>
            <br/>
            <em>Image by Katerina Bartosova, acquired from <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Graceful_fox_in_a_rocky_forest_(Unsplash).jpg">Wikimedia Commons</a>, used under <a href="https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/deed.en">CC0</a>.</em>
          </div>

            <p>This reassures people that you know what you are thoughtful, responsible, and know what you are doing.</p>

            <h4>Freepik</h4>

            <p>I don't know much about <a href="https://www.freepikcompany.com/about_us">Freepik</a>, but when I was asked in class where students could find imagery that they coulds use for animated characters, well a Google search turned them up!</p>

            <p>Freepik allows you to select images for <a href="https://www.freepik.com/free-photos-vectors/character-animation">character animation</a> and has a <b>License Filter</b> so that you can select <b>Free</b> images.</b></p>

            <p>Here is an <a href="https://www.freepik.com/free-vector/flat-design-animation-frames-element-collection_31630110.htm">example of a rollerskater that I found</a>, that we could use to make an animated sprite.</p>

            <p>The <b>license information</b> is provided to the right along with an indication that <b>attribution</b> is required. Clicking this asks me how I will be usign the image and then gives me guidance on what I need to do. This seems pretty clear to me. If I use the image on the Web then I need to add a statement that links to the source and says: "<em>Image by <a href="https://www.freepik.com/free-vector/flat-design-animation-frames-element-collection_31630110.htm">Freepik</a></em>".</p>

            <p>I am going to be even clearer than that and make it as explicit as I can that the image came from this source.</p>

            <div style="padding:1em;padding-left:4em"><img width=300 src="https://jsndyks.github.io/cityBootCamp/images/freepik/composite7842533.jpg"/>
              <br/>
              <em>Image by <a href="https://www.freepik.com/free-vector/flat-design-animation-frames-element-collection_31630110.htm">Freepik</a>, acquired from their <a href="https://www.freepik.com/free-vector/flat-design-animation-frames-element-collection_31630110.htm">Flat design animation frames element collection</a>.</em>
            </div>

            <p>Now, it turns out that if you <b>Go Premium</b> you can use some of the <a href="https://www.freepikcompany.com/about_us">Freepik</a> images without attribution. As you are studying, I see no advantage to this. When discussing the pros and cons with students in class, somebody asked me:</p>

            <blockquote>But how will you [lecturers] know whether we have gone premium or not?</blockquote>

            <p>Well, we may not. Or we may check, and ask for evidence. But in a way, it's the wrong question.
              We need to know the sources of all the materials and media that you use. If you don't mention a source, then our assumption is that you have made the thing : code, essay, media, whatever.
              So you always need to be clear about where your materials come from. If you had paid for a premium account, I would suggest using the image as follows:
            </p>

            <p>When you drive a car in a residential area, <em>somebody might not see you doing more than 30mph</em>, but are not being fair others who you put at risk.<br/>
            When you fancy a muffin from the coffee shop, <em>somebody might not see you pinch one without paying if you are quick</em>, but you are not being fair to those from whom you take.<br/>
            But these are not behaviours that operate within the law - whether anybody sees you or not.
            It's not about whether you get caught, it's about the way you behave and the harm you may do to others. Using the work of others is fine, as long as you do so within the restrictions that apply.
            So we urge, and indeed require you to <em>operate within information laws</em>, and this means that <em>you must understand and respect copyright, acknowledge sources, and use content that you have acquired from elsewhere responsibly</em>.  And you must be explicit about this.
            </p>
            <p>In short:</p>
            <ul>
             <li>Be <b>responsible</b> - understand the law and operate within it</li>
             <li>Be <b>explicit</b> - let whoever sees your work know exactly where it is originates from</li> 
             <li>Be <b>cautious</b> - if you are not sure whether you can use the material, don't use it;<br/>
            if you are not sure whether your acknowledgment is sufficiently explicit, be more explicit</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Example</h2>
            <p>I have put together a siumple example sketch that uses <a href="https://www.freepik.com/serie/31630108">a series images that provide animated character sequences</a> from <a href="https://www.freepik.com">Freepik</a>.<br/>The sketch also shows how you might use these media and acknowledge the sources in line with the rights under which we are allowed to do so.</p>

        This may not be the best way to do things, but it is explicit and within the rights under which I am allowed to use the images.<br/>I encourage you to find similar or better solutions.</p>

  <h4>Images</h4>

  <p>You'll need <b>some images</b> to make the code work!</p>
  <p>But you know where to get these, and how to use them. Just drag/save composite images into your sketch folder and list them in the <code>imageFiles</code> and <code>imageRights</code> arrays as I have here. The image file names must match those that you use to name your files.</p>
  <div class="prettyprint" style="display: block;">
    <pre class="brush: processing; gutter: false; toolbar: false; highlight: [0]">
