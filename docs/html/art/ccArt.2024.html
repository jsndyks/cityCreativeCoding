				<p>
					As students who have come to City, University of London to study for a degree in the Department of
					Computer Science, you may be wondering what has art got to do with your studies. Perhaps you have
					arrived here with qualifications in the sciences, mathematics or technology. As you learn and
					enhance your coding skills, most of your effort is likely to be in developing a structured, logical
					way of thinking. You will learn new technical skills, new programming constructions and approaches.
					You will learn to apply those skills in a systematic and rigorous way.
				</p>

				<p>
					Yet there is also a space for creative thinking and expression. Sometimes this might have very
					direct application such as in the development of a game or ideas for a new apps. But creative
					thinking can also help in problem solving, in developing your own 'voice' or approach to computer
					science. In this session we will look at some of the ways people have mixed art with computer
					science to express themselves creatively as well as expand the range of tools available to you in
					Processing to express yourself.
				</p>

				<p>
					For an enlightening account of this blend of 'computer science thinking' and expressive visual art,
					have a read of this <a
						href="https://www.artnome.com/news/2020/8/24/interview-with-generative-artist-jared-tarbell"
						target="_blank">interview with Jared Tarbell</a> who produced many artworks with Processing,
					including <i>Substrate</i> shown above.
				</p>

				<p>
					Processing was originally created for the purpose of providing artists with access to the
					computational space. If you watched the <a href="https://bit.ly/helloWorldProcessing" target="_blank">Hello World! Processing documentary</a>, you will have heard <i>Casey Reas</i>, one of the original designers of Processing,
					explain that the idea was to allow new programmers to create a
					'sketch book' of quickly generated programs that could explore different ideas. This digital
					sketchbook provides a medium for the programmer similar to a painter's oil and canvas.
				</p>

				<p>
					You can see some examples of how programmers and artists have mixed the rigour of programming with
					the creativity of design, artistic expression and experimentation with Processing:
				</p>

					<li><a href="https://fyprocessing.tumblr.com" target="_blank">For Your Processing</a> &mdash; A
						curated list of interesting sketches created in Processing.</li>

						&mdash; Collection of examples to support the (first edition) book 'Generative Design'.</li>
					<li><a href="http://www.complexification.net/gallery/" target="_blank">Gallery of Computation</a>
						&mdash; Jared Tarbell's beautiful sketches created with Processing.</li>
					<li><a href="https://openprocessing.org" target="_blank">openProcessing.org</a> &mdash; A huge
						collection of shared Processing sketches.</li>

						Processing examples with an emphasis on geometric animations and optical illusions.</li>
				</ul>


				<h4>Copyright, plagiarism and inspiration</h4>

				<p>
					Browsing the internet for examples of what others have done with Processing can be an effective way
					of gaining inspiration for your own work and getting a sense of programming possibilities. However
					you must be aware of two important rules when making use of the works of others:
				</p>

				<p>
					Firstly, <b>do not infringe copyright</b>. If you wish to use, for example, a sample from someone's
					musical creation, are there copyright restrictions placed on the work that would prevent you from
					doing this? It is important to respect copyright because that will allow you to protect your own
					work should you create something original.
				</p>

				<p>
					Under the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act, 1988, Section 32(2) of the Act allows copying of a
					sound recording, film or broadcast provided the copying is:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li> (i) done by a person giving or receiving instruction, and</li>
                        <li>(ii) accompanied by a sufficient acknowledgement</li>
                    </ul> 
                    <p>
                    So this means that in practice,
					you can use copyrighted material for learning purposes as part of your education, but should not
					share copyrighted materials more widely.
				</p>

				<p>
					A safer approach to using media created by others is to use materials that have licenses that permit
					or encourage sharing. In particular, media distributed under the <a
						href="https://creativecommons.org" target="_blank">creative commons</a> (cc) is a good source
					that shouldn't have copyright problems. A useful site for searching for creative commons material is
					<a href="https://search.creativecommons.org" target="_blank">search.creativecommons.org</a>.
				</p>

				<p>
					Secondly, <b>do not plagiarise others' work</b>. Plagiarism means copying someone else's work, such
					as their code, or design <i>without making it clear that it is their work, not your own</i>. In
					other words, if you use someone else's work as a basis for your own, you should make it clear,
					through attribution, where that source material came from and make it easy for the reader to know
					what is your own work and what belongs to others. Apart from being wrong, copying others' material
					without understanding exactly how it works is a very poor way of learning and is unlikely to make
					you a better programmer.
				</p>

                    <h4>Important Acknowledgment : Prof. Jo Wood</h4>

                <p>At this point it is wise to make it clear that while <em>Jason Dykes</em> is leading this session, 
                    the materials were originally developed by <b>Jo Wood</b>.</p>
                <p>What we are looking at today is very much in Jo's inimitable image.</p>
                <p><b>The art, examples, code and ideas are all Jo's.</b></p>
                <p>
                    Jason has permission from Jo to adapt these materials a little to suit his style and present them to you.<br/>
                But the <em>credit</em> is very definitely with Jo.</p>

				<h3>2. Randomness</h3>
				<p>
					Adding some randomness to your sketches is one way of adding visual interest. We've seen several
					examples of this already, such as when we generated moving balls that had a random velocity. The
					Processing method
					<code><a href="https://processing.org/reference/random_.html" target="_blank">random()</a></code> is
					a handy way of generating the random numbers we might use in our sketches. It normally takes two
					parameters specifying the range of numbers from which a random value is generated. For example:
				<pre class="brush: processing; gutter: false; toolbar: false;">float xPosition = random(7,101);</pre>
				would generate a random number somewhere between 7 and 101 and store that number inside the variable
				<code>xPosition</code>.
				</p>

				<p>
					To see how just a little randomness can add interest to a sketch, let's consider the following
					simple sketch that draws 8 squares in a row. This is very similar to the squares example we have
					seen before, but in this case we will use the
					<code><a href="https://processing.org/reference/quad_.html" target="_blank">quad()</a></code> rather
					than the
					<code><a href="https://processing.org/reference/rect_.html" target="_blank">rect()</a></code>
					method. <code>quad()</code> takes 4 pairs of parameters, each identifying the position of a corner
					of the shape. We use a simple for loop to draw 8 of these squares, each with a width and height of
					90 pixels (stored inside the variable <code>sSize</code>):

  noStroke();
  fill(0,0,200,100); // Transparent blue

  float xPos   = 40;
  float yPos   = 50;
  float sSize  = 90;

  for (int i=0; i&lt;8; i=i+1)
  {
    quad(xPos,         yPos,
         xPos + sSize, yPos,
         xPos + sSize, yPos + sSize,
         xPos,         yPos + sSize);

    xPos = xPos + 100;
  }
}</pre>

				<p>
					The reason we have used <code>quad()</code> rather than <code>rect()</code> in this example is that
					it allows us to control the position of each corner of each square independently. This is where we
					can add a simple random number to the position of each:
				</p>

				<pre class="brush: processing; gutter: false; toolbar: false;">
for (int i=0; i&lt;8; i=i+1)
{
  quad(xPos + random(-10,10),         yPos + random(-10,10),
       xPos + sSize + random(-10,10), yPos + random(-10,10),
       xPos + sSize + random(-10,10), yPos + sSize + random(-10,10),
       xPos + random(-10,10),         yPos + sSize + random(-10,10));

  xPos = xPos + 100;
}</pre>

				<img src="https://staff.city.ac.uk/~jwo/bootcamp2020/lecture11ArtAndMedia/images/randomSquares.png"
					width="860" height="200" alt="8 squares" />

			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="units-row">
			<div class="unit-70">
				<!-- Row break ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ -->
				<p>
					The only changes made to the sketch are to add <code>random(-10,10)</code> to each x and y position
					for each corner. If you were to run the sketch though, the result might be a little unexpected
					(click the sketch to the right).
				</p>

				<p>
					The squares appear to wobble about rather than produce the static irregular shapes we might have
					expected. This is because as the <code>draw()</code> loop repeats 60 times every second, new random
					numbers are generated which are then used to reposition each square's corner points.
				</p>

				<p>
					This may be a desirable outcome depending on what you are trying to achieve, but if you want your
					shapes to stay still, you have a number of choices. The first might be to stop the sketch from
					repeating the <code>draw()</code> code. We can turn off the 60 times a second repetition with a
					single simple command <code>noLoop()</code>. This is a nice simple option, but has the disadvantage
					that if we want other parts of our sketch to move, turning off the looping in <code>draw()</code>
					will prevent this.
				</p>

				<p>
					An alternative is that we can force Processing to generate the same set of random numbers each time
					the <code>draw()</code> loop is called. This can be achieved using the
					<code><a href="https://processing.org/reference/randomSeed_.html" target="_blank">randomSeed()</a></code>
					method. For example, including the line
				<pre class="brush: processing; gutter: false; toolbar: false;">randomSeed(1234);</pre> at the start of
				<code>draw()</code> will generate the same sequence of random numbers every time <code>draw()</code> is
				called. You can change the number <code>1234</code> to whatever you like and each seed value will
				generate its own unique sequence of random numbers. This is a useful way of providing the same sequence
				of random numbers every time you run your sketch.
				</p>

				<div class="tip">
					To see some examples of how you might extend the idea of randomly shifting the corners or appearance
					of shapes you may wish to look at the <a
						href="https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/mod/page/view.php?id=420962">Tile Generator project
						suggestions</a>. Below, for example, the same idea of making small random changes to the
					positions of regularly spaced shapes is used to create a set of cubes that look as if they were
					hand-drawn (using the <a href="https://www.gicentre.net/software#/handy/" target="_blank">Handy
						sketch library for Processing</a>):

				<h4>Other forms of Randomness</h4>

				<p>
					The <code>random()</code> function is very simple to use and works in many different situations. One
					of its drawbacks for using this method for drawing is that every time a new random number is
					generated, the new number is completely independent of the one before it. This means that if, say,
					position of a shape is set using <code>random()</code>, it can appear to jump around the screen in a
					very distracting way:

				<p>
					An alternative is to use Processing's <code>noise()</code> method instead of <code>random()</code>.
					This also generates random numbers, but in this case, each subsequent random number can be made to
					be a little similar to the previous one in the sequence. To see how this works, see the <code><a
						href="https://processing.org/reference/noise_.html" target="_blank">noise()</code> reference page</a>.
				</p>

				<p>
					Although <code>noise()</code> can produce random numbers (between 0 and 1), it takes one or more
					parameters and will produce the <i>same random number for any given parameter value</i>. But if we
					provide something like the <code>frameCount</code> as a parameter, we can make that random number
					change slowly on each redraw.
				</p>

				<p>
					Below is a simple modification to the randomly positioned circle sketch that uses
					<code>noise()</code> instead of <code>random()</code> to generate a much more smooth random
					movement.

				<h3>3. Working with Sound</h3>
				<p>
					For the first week we have been working exclusively with graphics in our Processing sketches. It is
					possible to use other media too, and in particular sound and video. In order to extend Processing to
					do this, we need to make use of the ability to import <i>libraries</i> into our sketches. A library
					is simply an extra set of classes written by someone else that can be bundled in with your own
					sketch. There are many libraries available in Processing &mdash; see the <a
						href="https://processing.org/reference/libraries/" target="_blank">Processing library
						documentation</a>.
				</p>

                <h4>3.1 Sound Basics</h4>

				<p>
					To work with sound in your sketches, one of the easiest libraries to work with is the <a
						href="https://processing.org/reference/libraries/sound/index.html" target="_blank">Processing
						Sound library</a>. To install the library, select the
					<code>Sketch-&gt;Import Library -&gt; Add Library...</code> menu item and select <i>Sound</i>
					authored by <i>The Processing Foundation</i>. You only need do this once to store the library on
					your computer. It contains functionality to play sound files (e.g. samples or MP3 music files),
					generate synthesised sounds and monitor sound input.
				</p>

				<p>
					To see how to use the sound library, let's consider a simple sketch that plays some sound samples
					whenever certain keys are pressed:
				</p>

import processing.sound.*;   // Import the library that does the sound handling.

SoundFile kick, snare, hiHat;  // Each sample in its own object.

void setup()
{
  size(300, 200);

  kick  = new SoundFile(this,"kickDrum.wav");
  snare = new SoundFile(this,"snareDrum.wav");
  hiHat = new SoundFile(this,"hiHat.wav");
}

void draw()
{
  noLoop();		// Stops Processing from redrawing at 60 fps.
}

void keyPressed()
{
  if (key == ' ')
  {
    kick.play();
  }
  else if (key == 's')
  {
    snare.play();
  }

				<p>
					In terms of programming, there is very little that is new here. What you may not have seen
					previously is the first line <code>import processing.sound.*;</code>. The <code>import</code>
					statement is used whenever you need to import a library that is not part of the core Processing
					language. In this case, the full name of the library is <code>processing.sound</code> and the
					<code>*</code> ('wildcard') at the end simply indicates that we wish to be able to use any of the
					classes contained within the library.
				</p>

				<p>
					The three lines in <code>setup()</code> each initialise new objects <code>kick</code>,
					<code>snare</code> and <code>hiHat</code>, all of which are of type <code>SoundFile</code>. Just
					like we have previously declared variables to store numbers or colours or text, this type is a
					variable capable of storing a complete sound sample. The keyword <code>this</code> tells the class
					that is it 'this' sketch that needs to load the samples, and the second parameter identifies the
					names of the sound files that store the samples.

				</p>

				<div class="tip">
					If you are going to work with sound files, you need to place them in to your sketch somehow. The
					easiest way is to drag the file with the mouse into the Processing code window. This will create a
					local copy of the dragged file that sits inside a <code>data</code> folder in the sketch location.
					<br /><br />
					To run the drum kit sketch above, you will need to drag three sample files, one for each drum/cymbal
					type into the sketch. You can download those three sample files, all of which have creative commons
					licenses, by right-clicking them here:
					<br /><br />
					<ul>
						<li><a href="https://bit.ly/3ylLrOn" target="_blank">kickDrum wav file</a></li>
						<li><a href="https://bit.ly/3Vo7Qoa" target="_blank">snareDrum wav file</a></li>
						<li><a href="https://bit.ly/3rDZGtV" target="_blank">hiHat wav file</a></li>
					</ul>
					<P>If you have difficulty downloading these files, get them in a ZIP archive from here :
                        <a href="https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/mod/resource/view.php?id=420931">Sound Files</a>.<p>
				</div>

				<p>
					The remains of the drum kit sketch just uses Processing's <code>keyPressed()</code> method to
					respond to presses of the spacebar, 'S' and 'H' keys to trigger the bass drum, snare drum and hi-hat
					cymbal sounds respectively.

					While we can use interaction to trigger the drum samples, you might want to code when samples are
					played within your sketch itself. Or perhaps mix interaction and pre-coded sample triggers. In the
					example to the right we use Processing to create a simple drum machine.
				</p>

				<p>
					This approach provides an interesting one on which to base a demo.<br/>

				<h3>4. Sophisticated Sound Capability</h4>
                
                    <div class="challenge">
                        <p><b>Challenge - Sophisticated Sound Capability</b><br />
                            This section provides some additional possibilities for those who want to dive into the (amazing) <em>World of Sound in Processing</em>more fully.</p>
							<p>There are fantastic opportunities for those who want to explore and experiment, but we do not consider this to be <em>core activity</em>.</p>
                            <p>So, feel free to head to <b>Section 5</b> unless this sound stuff really excites you and you'd like to learn more and perhaps use more sophisticated sound capability in your demo.</p>
                    </div>

                    <h4>4.1 Longer music tracks</h4>
				<p>
					The approach above, where a sample is played in its entirely, when triggered works well for short
					samples. For longer samples, such as entire songs, we may wish to play only part of the sample, or
					pause it midway. The <code>SoundFile</code> class offers some <a
						href="https://processing.org/reference/libraries/sound/SoundFile.html" target="_blank">useful
						methods</a> for doing this.
				</p>

				<p>
					The example below shows a simple sound player that allows a song to be played and paused. It does
					this by keeping track of whether the song is being played or not with a Boolean variable
					<code>isPlaying</code> and calls the methods from the sound library, <code>play()</code> and
					<code>pause()</code> to turn the music on and off.
				</p>

				<pre class="brush: processing; gutter: false; toolbar: false;">import processing.sound.*;   // Import the library that does the sound handling.

SoundFile song;     // The extended song to play
boolean isPlaying;

void setup()
{
  size(400, 250);
  textSize(36);
  textAlign(CENTER,CENTER);
  song  = new SoundFile(this, "loop7.mp3");
  song.play();
  isPlaying = true;
}

void draw()
{
  background(0);
  String message;
  if (isPlaying)
  {
    message = "Playing";
  }
  else
  {
    message = "Paused";
  }
  text(message,width/2,height/2);
}

void keyPressed()
{
  if (key == ' ')  // Toggle pause on or off.
  {
    if (isPlaying)
    {
      song.pause();
      isPlaying = false;
    }
    else
    {
      song.play();
      isPlaying = true;
    }
  }
}</pre>
				<p>
					To load the file <code>loop7.mp3</code>, it must have previously been dragged into the code window
					so a copy of it is accessible to the sketch (if you want to run the sketch yourself, you might want
					to find your own .mp3, .wav or .aiff file and drag it into the sketch).
				</p>


				<h4>4.2 Responding to Sound</h4>

				<p>
					It would be possible to trigger samples or play/pause music files in response to something other
					than key presses, such as mouse movements or colliding shapes. But as a final example of working
					with sound, we will draw some simple lines in response to the volume of the sound being played.
				</p>

				<p>
					To do this we will get the sound library to perform a <i>Fast Fourier Transform</i> (FFT) on the
					sound file. This is a way of extracting the amplitude (volume) of the sound at different
					frequencies, allowing us, for example to measure how much bass there is in the sound compared to
					higher frequencies such as cymbal or hi-hat sounds.
				</p>

				<p>
					To do this, we use the sound library's <code>FFT</code> class to do all the hard work for us. We use
					the array of amplitudes it generates (called <code>spectrum</code>) to create a shape representing
					the frequencies of the sound in real time.
				</p>

				<pre class="brush: processing; gutter: false; toolbar: false;">import processing.sound.*;

FFT fft;                                 // Fourier transform of the sound signal
int NUM_BANDS = 256;
float baseLine;                          // Position of the baseline.

void setup()
{
  size(532, 250);
  background(4, 60, 5);
  baseLine = 20;

  // Load the sound file.
  SoundFile sound = new SoundFile(this, "loop7.mp3");
  sound.play();

  // Tell the Fast Fourier Transformer to process the song file.
  fft = new FFT(this, NUM_BANDS);
  fft.input(sound);
}

void draw()
{
  // Draw a dark green slightly transparent background
  noStroke();
  fill(4, 60, 5, 5);
  rect(0, 0, width, height);

  // Draw bright green lines to represent volume
  stroke(142, 187, 82);
  strokeWeight(2);

  fft.analyze();    // Analyse the current sound being played.

  beginShape();
  for (int i=0; i&lt;fft.spectrum.length*0.4; i=i+1)
  {
    float xPos = map(i, 0, fft.spectrum.length*0.4, 10, width-10);
    float yPos = map(sqrt(fft.spectrum[i]), 0, 1, baseLine, baseLine-height*0.7);
    vertex(xPos, yPos);
  }
  endShape();

  // Move the baseline down the screen every frame until it gets to bottom.
  baseLine++;
  if (baseLine &gt; height-10)
  {
    baseLine = 20;
  }
}</pre>

				<p>
					When this new content for the <code>draw()</code> method is added to the sound player sketch, it
					produces output as shown below:
				</p>

					<iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/139582572" width="532" height="250" frameborder="0"
						webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>
				</p>
				<p>
					The <code>for</code> loop iterates though the first 40% of the current <i>spectrum</i> produced by the FFT. As
					the value of <code>i</code> increases in the loop, so the value of <code>fft.spectrum[i]</code>
					represents the amplitude of sound at increasingly higher frequencies. These amplitude values that
					are between 0-1 are then scaled to be between 0 and 0.7 times the height of the sketch using
					processing's <code>map()</code> method.
				</p>


				<div class="tip">
					The example above takes the sound input from a <code>SoundFile</code> (stored in a
					<code>sound</code> object). We can change the input to be the computer's internal microphone so that
					we visualize any sound it picks up.<br/>To do this, simply replace the <code>SoundFile</code> with
					<code>AudioIn</code> and call its <code>start()</code> method instead of <code>play()</code>:
					<br /><br />
					<pre class="brush: processing; gutter: false; toolbar: false;">//SoundFile sound = new SoundFile(this, "loop7.mp3");
//sound.play();

// Link to the computer's mic
AudioIn sound;
sound = new AudioIn(this, 0);
sound.start();</pre>

				</div>

				<p>
					There is plenty more to discover with the Processing sound library should you wish to do more with
					sound. If you are interested in doing this for your demo, have a browse of the <a
						href="https://processing.org/reference/libraries/sound/" target="_blank"> sound library
						documentation</a> which includes some examples.

				<h3>5. Working with Video</h3>

                <div class="challenge">
                    <p><b>Challenge - Working with Video</b><br />
                        This section introduces capability for using and manipulating <em>video in Processing</em>.</p>
                        <p>Once again, there are some amazing opportunities here, but we do not consider this to be <em>core activity</em>.</p>
                        <p>Feel free to head straight to <b>Section 6</b> unless you want to learn more about video and are perhaps thinking about using it in your demo.</p>
                </div>

				<p>
					Finally, we will briefly consider how to display video files in Processing. Again we will make use
					of a library that does most of the hard work for us. As before, the very first time you wish to use
					a new library, you need to download it and install from the
					<code>Sketch -&gt; Import Library... -&gt; Add Library...</code> menu, this time selecting
					<code>Video</code> by the Processing Foundation. In your code, the library needs to be imported with
					the statement <code>import processing.video.*;</code>, which tells Processing that we wish to make
					use of any of the classes stored in the <code>processing.video</code> package.
				</p>

				<p>
					As with sound files, you will also need to drag a video file into your sketch so that Processing
					knows where to look when reading the file.
				</p>

				<p>
					The steps for actually displaying the video are quite simple, and very much like those taken to play
					a sound file. It is best illustrated with an example, in this case a simple sketch that will read in
					a video file (downloaded from <a href="https://bit.ly/helloWorldProcessing"
						target="_blank">HelloWorld! Processing</a>) and play it in the sketch:
				</p>
				<pre class="brush: processing; gutter: false; toolbar: false;">
import processing.video.*;    // Needed to display video.

Movie myVideo;                // Stores the video object.

void setup()
{
  size(640, 360);
  myVideo = new Movie(this, "HelloWorldClip.mov");
  myVideo.play();
}

void draw()
{
  // Display the video at position (0,0) at its natural size.
  image(myVideo, 0, 0);
}

// This is needed to read in the movie while it is playing.
void movieEvent(Movie videoBuffer)
{
  videoBuffer.read();
}</pre>

				<p>
					After importing the video library, the first line creates a <code>Movie</code> object which we've
					called <code>myVideo</code> in this example. Remember <code>Movie</code> (capital 'M') is the name
					of the class that can store the video data and contains methods that operate on the data and
					<code>myVideo</code> is the object that is an instance of the <code>Movie</code> class.
				</p>

				<p>
					<code>myVideo</code> is initialised inside <code>setup()</code> where it is read from the file
					<code>HelloWorldClip.mov</code>. This needs to correspond to the name of the file you have dragged
					into the Processing window. If you use a different video file, you would need to edit the code to
					use the relevant name. Once loaded, the video is started by calling the <code>.play()</code> method
					of the object.
				</p>

				<p>
					The display of the video is done inside the <code>draw()</code> method using the
					<code>image()</code> command. This can take either 3 or 5 parameters. In this case, we use the
					3-parameter version that firstly names the <code>Movie</code> object to display
					(<code>myVideo</code> in this example), then the x and y position of the top left of the display
					position, just as we might if displaying a rectangle.
				</p>

				<p>
					The only other method we need to add to our sketch when dealing with videos is one called
					<code>void movieEvent()</code>. This is a special method that Processing will look for whenever it
					needs to read in a bit more of the video from the file.
				</p>


				<h4>Controlling the size and position of a video display</h4>

				<p>
					We can build some quite interesting display designs with videos because once a video is read, it can
					be displayed as many times as you wish and at any size. For example, the sketch below is exactly the
					same as our simple video sketch above except for the highlighted lines that this time use two nested
					loops to display 25 copies of the same video:
				</p>

		</div>
		<div class="units-row">
			<div class="unit-70">
				<!-- Row break ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ -->
				<pre class="brush: processing; gutter: false; toolbar: false; highlight: [16,17,18,19,20,21,22]">
import processing.video.*;    // Needed to display video.

Movie myVideo;                // Stores the video object.

void setup()
{
  size(800, 500);
  myVideo = new Movie(this, "HelloWorldClip.mov");
  myVideo.play();
}

void draw()
{
  background(0);

  for (int row=0; row&lt;5; row=row+1)
  {
    for (int col=0; col&lt;5; col=col+1)
    {
      image(myVideo, 10 + col*160, 10 + row*100,140, 90);
    }
  }
}

// This is needed to read in the movie while it is playing.
void movieEvent(Movie videoBuffer)
{
  videoBuffer.read();
}</pre>


				<p>
					We can combine video playback with any number of other Processing graphical display options. For
					example it would be possible to display the video at the current mouse position, or to change its
					size according to the mouse position.
				</p>

				<p>
					The final example below shows how the position of the video can move randomly using the
					<code>noise()</code> command, just as we did with the moving circle at the start of this session.
					Additionally, we use the <code>tint()</code> command to make the video display transparent (you will
					learn more about this in the session on image processing).
				</p>

				<pre class="brush: processing; gutter: false; toolbar: false;">
import processing.video.*;    // Needed to display video.

Movie myVideo;                // Stores the video object.

void setup()
{
  size(1200, 800);
  background(0);
  myVideo = new Movie(this, "HelloWorldClip.mov");
  myVideo.play();
  }

void draw()
{
  float px = map(noise(frameCount*0.01, 1), 0, 1, 0, width-myVideo.width);
  float py = map(noise(frameCount*0.01, 2), 0, 1, 0, height-myVideo.height);
  tint(255, 4);      // Make the video very transparent.
  image(myVideo, px, py, 600, 380);
}

// This is needed to read in the movie while it is playing.
void movieEvent(Movie videoBuffer)
{
  videoBuffer.read();
}
</pre>
