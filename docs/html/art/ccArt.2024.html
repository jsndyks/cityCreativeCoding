				<p>
					As students who have come to City, University of London to study for a degree in the Department of
					Computer Science, you may be wondering what has art got to do with your studies. Perhaps you have
					arrived here with qualifications in the sciences, mathematics or technology. As you learn and
					enhance your coding skills, most of your effort is likely to be in developing a structured, logical
					way of thinking. You will learn new technical skills, new programming constructions and approaches.
					You will learn to apply those skills in a systematic and rigorous way.
				</p>

				<p>
					Yet there is also a space for creative thinking and expression. Sometimes this might have very
					direct application such as in the development of a game or ideas for a new apps. But creative
					thinking can also help in problem solving, in developing your own 'voice' or approach to computer
					science. In this session we will look at some of the ways people have mixed art with computer
					science to express themselves creatively as well as expand the range of tools available to you in
					<i>Processing</i> to express yourself.
				</p>

				<p>
					For an enlightening account of this blend of 'computer science thinking' and expressive visual art,
					have a read of this <a
						href="https://www.artnome.com/news/2020/8/24/interview-with-generative-artist-jared-tarbell"
						target="_blank">interview with Jared Tarbell</a> who produced many artworks with <i>Processing</i>,
					including <i>Substrate</i> shown above.
				</p>

				<p>
					<i>Processing</i> was originally created for the purpose of providing artists with access to the
					computational space. If you watched the <a href="https://bit.ly/helloWorldProcessing" target="_blank">Hello World! <i>Processing</i> documentary</a>, you will have heard <i>Casey Reas</i>, one of the original designers of <i>Processing</i>,
					explain that the idea was to allow new programmers to create a
					'sketch book' of quickly generated programs that could explore different ideas. This digital
					sketchbook provides a medium for the programmer similar to a painter's oil and canvas.
				</p>

				<p>
					You can see some examples of how programmers and artists have mixed the rigour of programming with
					the creativity of design, artistic expression and experimentation with Processing:
				</p>

						curated list of interesting sketches created in <i>Processing</i>.</li>

				</ul>


				<h4>Copyright, plagiarism and inspiration</h4>

				<p>
					Browsing the internet for examples of what others have done with <i>Processing</i> can be an effective way
					of gaining inspiration for your own work and getting a sense of programming possibilities. However
					you must be aware of two important rules when making use of the works of others:
				</p>

				<p>
					Firstly, <b>do not infringe copyright</b>. If you wish to use, for example, a sample from someone's
					musical creation, are there copyright restrictions placed on the work that would prevent you from
					doing this? It is important to respect copyright because that will allow you to protect your own
					work should you create something original.
				</p>

				<p>
					Under the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act, 1988, Section 32(2) of the Act allows copying of a
					sound recording, film or broadcast provided the copying is:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li> (i) done by a person giving or receiving instruction, and</li>
                        <li>(ii) accompanied by a sufficient acknowledgement</li>
                    </ul> 
                    <p>
                    So this means that in practice,
					you can use copyrighted material for learning purposes as part of your education, but should not
					share copyrighted materials more widely.
				</p>

				<p>
					A safer approach to using media created by others is to use materials that have licenses that permit
					or encourage sharing. In particular, media distributed under the <a
						href="https://creativecommons.org" target="_blank">creative commons</a> (cc) is a good source
					that shouldn't have copyright problems. A useful site for searching for creative commons material is
					<a href="https://search.creativecommons.org" target="_blank">search.creativecommons.org</a>.
				</p>

				<p>
					Secondly, <b>do not plagiarise others' work</b>. Plagiarism means copying someone else's work, such
					as their code, or design <i>without making it clear that it is their work, not your own</i>. In
					other words, if you use someone else's work as a basis for your own, you should make it clear,
					through attribution, where that source material came from and make it easy for the reader to know
					what is your own work and what belongs to others. Apart from being wrong, copying others' material
					without understanding exactly how it works is a very poor way of learning and is unlikely to make
					you a better programmer.
				</p>

                    <h4>Important Acknowledgment : Prof. Jo Wood</h4>

                <p>At this point it is wise to make it clear that while <em>Jason Dykes</em> is leading this session, 
                    the materials were originally developed by <b>Jo Wood</b>.</p>
                <p>What we are looking at today is very much in Jo's inimitable image.</p>
                <p><b>The art, examples, code and ideas are all Jo's.</b></p>
                <p>
                    Jason has permission from Jo to adapt these materials a little to suit his style and present them to you.<br/>
                But the <em>credit</em> is very definitely with Jo.</p>

				<h3>2. Randomness</h3>
				<p>
					Adding some randomness to your sketches is one way of adding visual interest. We've seen several
					examples of this already, such as when we generated moving balls that had a random velocity. The
					<i>Processing</i> method
					<code><a href="https://processing.org/reference/random_.html" target="_blank">random()</a></code> is
					a handy way of generating the random numbers we might use in our sketches. It normally takes two
					parameters specifying the range of numbers from which a random value is generated. For example:
				<pre class="brush: processing; gutter: false; toolbar: false;">float xPosition = random(7,101);</pre>
				would generate a random number somewhere between 7 and 101 and store that number inside the variable
				<code>xPosition</code>.
				</p>

				<p>
					To see how just a little randomness can add interest to a sketch, let's consider the following
					simple sketch that draws 8 squares in a row. This is very similar to the squares example we have
					seen before, but in this case we will use the
					<code><a href="https://processing.org/reference/quad_.html" target="_blank">quad()</a></code> rather
					than the
					<code><a href="https://processing.org/reference/rect_.html" target="_blank">rect()</a></code>
					method. <code>quad()</code> takes 4 pairs of parameters, each identifying the position of a corner
					of the shape. We use a simple for loop to draw 8 of these squares, each with a width and height of
					90 pixels (stored inside the variable <code>sSize</code>):

}

void draw()

  noStroke();
  fill(0,0,200,100); // Transparent blue

  float xPos   = 40;
  float yPos   = 50;
  float sSize  = 90;

  for (int i=0; i&lt;8; i=i+1)
  {
    quad(xPos,         yPos,
         xPos + sSize, yPos,
         xPos + sSize, yPos + sSize,
         xPos,         yPos + sSize);

    xPos = xPos + 100;
  }
}</pre>

				<p>
					The reason we have used <code>quad()</code> rather than <code>rect()</code> in this example is that
					it allows us to control the position of each corner of each square independently. This is where we
					can add a simple random number to the position of each:
				</p>

				<pre class="brush: processing; gutter: false; toolbar: false;">
for (int i=0; i&lt;8; i=i+1)
{
  quad(xPos + random(-10,10),         yPos + random(-10,10),
       xPos + sSize + random(-10,10), yPos + random(-10,10),
       xPos + sSize + random(-10,10), yPos + sSize + random(-10,10),
       xPos + random(-10,10),         yPos + sSize + random(-10,10));

  xPos = xPos + 100;
}</pre>

				<img src="https://staff.city.ac.uk/~jwo/bootcamp2020/lecture11ArtAndMedia/images/randomSquares.png"
					width="860" height="200" alt="8 squares" />

			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="units-row">
			<div class="unit-70-cc">
				<!-- Row break ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ -->
				<p>
					The only changes made to the sketch are to add <code>random(-10,10)</code> to each x and y position
					for each corner. If you were to run the sketch though, the result might be a little unexpected
					(click the sketch to the right).
				</p>

				<p>
					The squares appear to wobble about rather than produce the static irregular shapes we might have
					expected. This is because as the <code>draw()</code> loop repeats 60 times every second, new random
					numbers are generated which are then used to reposition each square's corner points.
				</p>

				<p>
					This may be a desirable outcome depending on what you are trying to achieve, but if you want your
					shapes to stay still, you have a number of choices. The first might be to stop the sketch from
					repeating the <code>draw()</code> code. We can turn off the 60 times a second repetition with a
					single simple command <code>noLoop()</code>. This is a nice simple option, but has the disadvantage
					that if we want other parts of our sketch to move, turning off the looping in <code>draw()</code>
					will prevent this.
				</p>

				<p>
					An alternative is that we can force <i>Processing</i> to generate the same set of random numbers each time
					the <code>draw()</code> loop is called. This can be achieved using the
					<code><a href="https://processing.org/reference/randomSeed_.html" target="_blank">randomSeed()</a></code>
					method. For example, including the line
				<pre class="brush: processing; gutter: false; toolbar: false;">randomSeed(1234);</pre> at the start of
				<code>draw()</code> will generate the same sequence of random numbers every time <code>draw()</code> is
				called. You can change the number <code>1234</code> to whatever you like and each seed value will
				generate its own unique sequence of random numbers. This is a useful way of providing the same sequence
				of random numbers every time you run your sketch.
				</p>

				<div class="tip">
					To see some examples of how you might extend the idea of randomly shifting the corners or appearance
					of shapes you may wish to look at the <a
						href="https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/mod/page/view.php?id=420962">Tile Generator project
						suggestions</a>. Below, for example, the same idea of making small random changes to the
					positions of regularly spaced shapes is used to create a set of cubes that look as if they were
					hand-drawn (using the <a href="https://www.gicentre.net/software#/handy/" target="_blank">Handy
						sketch library for <i>Processing</i></a>):

				<h4>Other forms of Randomness</h4>

				<p>
					The <code>random()</code> function is very simple to use and works in many different situations. One
					of its drawbacks for using this method for drawing is that every time a new random number is
					generated, the new number is completely independent of the one before it. This means that if, say,
					position of a shape is set using <code>random()</code>, it can appear to jump around the screen in a
					very distracting way:

				<!-- Left column -->

				<p>
					An alternative is to use <i>Processing</i>'s <code>noise()</code> method instead of <code>random()</code>.
					This also generates random numbers, but in this case, each subsequent random number can be made to
					be a little similar to the previous one in the sequence. To see how this works, see the <code><a
						href="https://processing.org/reference/noise_.html" target="_blank">noise()</code> reference page</a>.
				</p>

				<p>
					Although <code>noise()</code> can produce random numbers (between 0 and 1), it takes one or more
					parameters and will produce the <i>same random number for any given parameter value</i>. But if we
					provide something like the <code>frameCount</code> as a parameter, we can make that random number
					change slowly on each redraw.
				</p>

				<p>
					Below is a simple modification to the randomly positioned circle sketch that uses
					<code>noise()</code> instead of <code>random()</code> to generate a much more smooth random
					movement.
