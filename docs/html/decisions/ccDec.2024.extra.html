            These exercises develop your ability to use if-statements in your code.
        </p>


        <div class="codeTask">
            This exercise is an adaptation of the “Heads or Tails” sketch from the lecture:
            <br /><br />
            <pre class="brush: processing; gutter: false; toolbar: false; ">float randomNumber;

void setup()
{
  size(200, 200);
  fill(0);
  textSize(48);
  textAlign(CENTER);

  randomNumber = random(2.0);
}

void draw()
{
  background(230, 255, 230);

  String message;
  if (randomNumber &lt; 1.0) {
    message = "TAILS";
  } else {
    message = "HEADS";
  }
  text(message, width/2, height/2);
}</pre>
            Copy this code into a new sketch. Save the sketch with the name “TwoCoins”.
            <br /><br />
            The aim is to extend this code so that it simulates two coin tosses instead of just one. The possible
            combinations for two coin tosses are TT, TH, HT, HH. Your sketch should print one of three messages:
            <br /><br />
            <ul>
                <li>“TWO TAILS” (combination TT)</li>
                <li>“TWO HEADS” (combination HH)</li>
                <li>“MIXED” (combinations TH and HT)</li>
            </ul>
            Develop your solution in three stages:
            <br /><br />
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Declare an additional variable at the top of the sketch (call it something like
                    <code>randomNumber2</code>) and initialise it in <code>setup()</code> to a random number in the
                    range 0 to 2. Check that your sketch runs (you won't see any new behaviour yet).
                    <br /><br />
                </li>

                <li>
                    Modify the if-statement in <code>draw()</code> so that the condition tests if <em>both</em> the
                    random numbers are less than 1. You should use the <code>&amp;&amp;</code> operator to do this.
                    Modify the message variable assignments so that the first one is “TWO TAILS” and the second one is
                    “WORK IN PROGRESS!”. Check that your sketch runs and behaves as expected. If you run it lots of
                    times you should find that it displays the message “TWO TAILS” roughly a quarter of the time.
                    <br /><br />
                </li>

                <li>
                    Extend the if-statement with extra cases to test for other combinations and set the message variable
                    appropriately. Check that your sketch runs and behaves as expected. If you run it lots of times you
                    should find that it displays “TWO TAILS” roughly a quarter of the time, “TWO HEADS” roughly a
                    quarter of the time, “MIXED” roughly half the time.
                </li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <div class="aside">

            Randomness has many uses.<br/>
            we have produced a whole page on <a href="https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/mod/page/view.php?id=465023">a whole
                Randomness</a> that you can use to find out more.

        </div>
        <br /><br />

        <div class="coreTask">
            For this task, create a new sketch and start with a blank page: strictly NO copy and paste.
            <br /><br />
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Add the usual <code>setup()</code> and <code>draw()</code> methods to your sketch. In
                    <code>setup()</code>, set the size of the sketch window to 200 pixels wide by 300 pixels high. To
                    start with, your sketch will simply draw a white-filled circle at a randomly chosen position.
                    Declare <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> variables at the top of the sketch. Then, in
                    <code>setup()</code>, initialise <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> with randomly chosen values (use
                    value ranges which guarantee that the point <code>(x,y)</code> is inside the sketch window). In
                    <code>draw()</code>, add code to draw a white-filled circle of radius 50, centered at
                    <code>(x,y)</code> on a grey background.
                    <br /><br />
                    Run your sketch several times and check that the circle is visible every time (many times, only part
                    of the circle will be visible, when the centre is close to an edge, but it should always be
                    partially visible).
                    <br /><br />
                </li>

                <li>
                    Add extra code to draw a white rectangle on top of the circle. The rectangle should be 130 pixels
                    wide and 20 pixels high, centred at <code>(x,y)</code>. The overall shape should look similar to an
                    underground sign.
                    <br /><br />
                </li>

                <li>
                    Add code so that whenever the mouse is inside the rectangle, the rectangle is filled blue instead of
                    white.
                    <br /><br />
                </li>

                <li>
                    Add code so that whenever the mouse is <i>not</i> inside the rectangle, but <i>is</i> inside the
                    circle, the circle is filled red instead of white.
                    <div class="tip">
                        The <code>dist()</code> command can be used to find the distance between two points. It is
                        documented in the official <a href="https://processing.org/reference/dist_.html">Processing
                            Reference Documentation</a>. A point is inside a circle if its distance from the centre is
                        less than the radius.
                    </div>

                    </ol>
                    <br /><br />
                </li>

                <li>
                    Modify the code which initialises <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> so that the <i>whole</i> of the
                    "underground sign" is always visible (making full use of the sketch window area).
                </li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <div class="codeTask">
            In this exercise and the next you will develop an animated ball bouncing inside a box. We start by adapting
            the scrolling text example from the lecture:
            <br /><br />
            <pre class="brush: processing; gutter: false; toolbar: false; ">float xPos; // x-position
float vx; // speed in x-direction

void setup()
{
  size(400,300);
  fill(255,177,8);
  textSize(48);

  xPos = width/2;  // Initialise xPos to centre of sketch
  vx = -2; // Set speed in x-direction to -2 (moving left)
}

void draw()
{
  background(64);

  String message = "The next station is Angel...";

  xPos = xPos + vx;  // Change x-position on each redraw

  text(message,xPos,(height/2) + 20);
}</pre>
            <ol>


                <li>
                    Copy this code into a new sketch and save it with the name "BouncingBall". Delete the line of code
                    in <code>draw()</code> which creates the String variable <code>message</code>.
                    <br /><br />
                </li>

                <li>
                    Delete the final line of code (<code>text(message, ...</code>) and replace it with code which
                    instead draws a circle centred at position <code>(xPos, height/2)</code>. Use a radius of about 50
                    pixels (you can change this later but, for now, a nice big fat ball makes it easier to see what is
                    happening). Best practice is to add an extra variable <code>radius</code> to your sketch (initialise
                    to 50 in <code>setup()</code>) and use that in <code>draw()</code> instead of the literal
                    <code>50</code>.
                    <br /><br />
                    Check that your sketch works as expected. The ball should start in the centre of the sketch and move
                    slowly to the left, eventually disappearing off screen.
                    <br /><br />
                </li>

                <li>
                    Now we want to make the ball bounce when it hits the edge of the window, rather than go straight
                    through. Add an if-statement at the end of <code>draw()</code> to check if the ball has reached the
                    left-hand edge of the window. Since the ball is moving more than one pixel in each frame, you should
                    test if the edge of the ball is <em>less than or equal</em> to zero (it might actually have started
                    to “penetrate the wall” but don't worry, the visual appearance will be fine).
                    <br /><br />
                    If the ball has reached the left-hand edge of the window your code should change the x-speed
                    (variable <code>vx</code>) so that in future frames it will move in the opposite direction. The
                    simplest way to do this is simply to assign a new value to <code>vx</code> which is the
                    <em>negation</em> of its old value: <code>vx = -vx;</code> (so if <code>vx</code> is -2 before this
                    assignment, it will be --2 = 2 afterwards).
                    <div class="tip">
                        Hint: the left hand edge of a circle is at an x-position which is <code>radius</code> pixels to
                        the left of its centre.
                    </div>
                    Check that your sketch works as expected. The ball should start in the centre of the sketch and move
                    slowly to the left. When it reaches the left edge it should “bounce”, reversing direction and moving
                    back across the screen to the right.
                    <br /><br />
                </li>

                <li>
                    Add an extra if-statement to deal with the ball colliding with the right-hand edge of the window.
                    (Or combine this case into the existing if-statement by modifying the boolean expression.)
                    <br /><br />
                    Check that your sketch works as expected. The ball should now move backwards and forwards across the
                    window, bouncing when it reaches left and right edges.
                </li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        <br /><br />

        <div class="codeTask">
            In this exercise you add movement in the y-direction to your bouncing ball sketch. You might worry that
            simultaneous movement in two dimensions will introduce all sorts of new complexities into your code. Luckily
            for us, we can treat movement in the two directions independently, using very similar code for both cases,
            and everything works out fine.
            <br /><br />
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Add extra variables <code>yPos</code> and <code>vy</code> to your sketch. In <code>setup()</code>,
                    initialise <code>yPos</code> to be halfway down the screen and initialise <code>vy</code> to 1 pixel
                    per frame.
                    <br /><br />
                    In <code>draw()</code>, modify the code which draws the ball so that it uses variable
                    <code>yPos</code> instead of <code>height/2</code>. Next to the assignment which adds
                    <code>vx</code> to <code>xPos</code>, add a new assignment which does the same for <code>vy</code>
                    and <code>yPos</code>.
                    <br /><br />
                    Check that your sketch works as expected. The ball should now move in a diagonal direction but it
                    won't yet bounce off the top or bottom edges of the window.
                    <br /><br />
                </li>

                <li>
                    Add code to make the ball bounce off the top and bottom edges. Copy and adapt the code you already
                    have for dealing with the left and right edges, replacing <code>xPos</code> and <code>vx</code> by
                    <code>yPos</code> and <code>vy</code> as appropriate.
                    <br /><br />
                    Check that your sketch works as expected. The ball should now move in diagonal directions bouncing
                    of all four walls. Congratulations!
                    <br /><br />

                <li>
                    Play around with the initialisation values in your sketch to see how they affect behaviour (window
                    size, fill colour, ball radius, initial position, velocity).

            <p>Once you have coded a ball bouncing in a box you will naturally want to add more sophisticated behaviours.<br/>
            Multiple balls? Balls of different sizes? Balls which collide with and bounce off other balls?<br/>All is
            possible!<br/>
            The necessary coding techniques are covered in future sessions. If you want a sneak preview, have

            Modify your bouncing ball so that it changes colour each time it bounces. You will need one or more new
            global (sketch-wide) variables to represent the current colour of the ball (for example you could have three
            variables, one each for red, green and blue). Then you can modify the code which draws the ball so that it
            sets the fill colour using these new variables, and modify the code which detects a bounce so that it
            assigns new values to them.

            <div class="tip">
                If you assign random values for red, green and blue, remember that the maximum range for each colour
                component is 0 to 255.

                    Write a sketch called “Hunt” which draws a circle at a randomly chosen position. Now modify the
                    sketch so that it only draws the circle when the mouse is inside the circle (so the user has to hunt
                    for the invisible circle using the mouse).
                    <br /><br />
                </li>
                <li>
                    To add a bit of interest to the Hunt game, allow only limited time for the user to find the circle;
                    when time is up, reveal the circle and display a GAME OVER message.

                    <div class="tip">
                        The variable <code>frameCount</code> keeps track of how many times <code>draw()</code> has been
                        executed since the sketch started running. You can use this to test if the user has run out of
                        time (for example, the default frame rate is 60 frames per second, so five seconds is up when
                        <code>frameCount</code> exceeds 5 x 60 = 300). When the game is over you can freeze the action
                        by setting the frame rate to zero using command <code>frameRate(0)</code>.
