On Thursday morning, please find a quiet place in or near to the University to participate in the lecture at 10am.
Then head to your labs.

Thursday afternoon involves face-to-face practical classes from **15:00-16:50** with teaching staff that you should attend to work on the _Loops & Groups_ lecture materials and practical exercises.
