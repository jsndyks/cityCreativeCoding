The _Dear Data Sketch_ assignment is closed now.

We received **100** submissions, which is fantastic!

Thanks so much to those of you who participated - we hope that it was fulfilling and will be beneficial as you continue with your studies next term.

We will be asking for feedback on #CreativeCoding in the New Year, setting up a pizza showcase event, writing _Creative Coding Commentaries_ for those of you who competed the assignment and distributing the digital badges.

For now - have a good break, take a rest and please celebrate a successful first term at Uni.
