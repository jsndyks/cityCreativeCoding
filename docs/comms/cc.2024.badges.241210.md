#### Creative Coding Badges

We have been using _OpenBadgeFactory_ to create your badges and look forward to issuing these in the new year.

Here's a sample:

Remember that badges will be awarded to all those who ...

- make a submission to the [Dear Data Sketch Assignment](https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/mod/assign/view.php?id=829302)
- engage with personal tutorials
- come to the party (pizza in January)
- complete a feedback exercise (quick, anonymous, in January)

On **make a submission** ... please submit anything at all ... even if it feels inconsequential and incomplete.

In our experience, students often _overestimate_ the quality of the work that we expect. So please don't let this dissuade you from completing the activity with a submission.

We understand that this is a new, time-constrained activity ... we have very few expectations. Just show us that you have been working on and use the _brief textual description_ to let us know what works, what doesn;t and any ambition beyond what you have submitted.

Submission is success!

We hope to be issuing plenty of badges and encourage you to submit your work.
