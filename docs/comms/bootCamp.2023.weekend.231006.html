<p>Hi folks,<br/>well done on a full week ... with lots of new concepts and lots of learning an lots of errors, missing semicolons and null pointer exceptions.</p>
<p>Take some time off this weekend: rest, recuperate, and remember ... that nutrition, hydration, exercise and sleep are essential for health and learning.</p>
<p>But, there are a couple of things to know - four actually:</p>

<ol>
    <li style="padding:1em">We need you to tell us whether you are coming to the Friday Fika.<br/>
        This is a compulsory event and part of your education, but we understand that some may have good reason to be elsewhere.
        We are ordering food and coffee and juice (and it looks really good) and so need to know numbers.<br/>
        <b style="color:#902020">Please let us know here BEFORE MONDAY 4pm</b> - <a href="https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=6081">https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=6081</a><br/>
        I will make the order on Monday afternoon</li>
    <li style="padding:1em">Please let us know how this week has been by answering the two questions in the <a href="https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=6081#coursecontentcollapse12">Weekend</a> section on Moodle.<br/>
        Please be realistic.
        <ul>
        <li><b>If it has been tough</b> - bring your efforts and questions to class next week and chat to the teachers. Or raise issues that you would like to discuss on Teams. I will have a Zoom Room for <i>Beginners</i> from 11-12:50 on Monday morning too, so you can connect there.
        <br/>And remember - we are deliberately introducing things quickly here, and we don't expect it all to stick. The modules that start in week 03 look at many of these concepts in much greater detail and give you more time to practice. You may not be able to code in Processing without errors, but you will be engaging with some of the concepts that will be key to your degree as you move forwards.</li>
        <li><b>If it has been easy</b> - try the lectures on <i>Data Vis</i> and <i>Art &amp; Media</i> that we have just released.<br/>It's not that these are <b>hard</b> but they are enabling. They build on what we have learned so far to introduce capabilities that give you lots of opportunities to be expressive, to be creative, and to play.<br/>There's tonnes of scope for surprising us, and yourselves, in there.</li></ul></li>
        <li>The <a href="https://teams.microsoft.com/l/team/19%3a3lrzoZ3pfVQ63BZzm6zZRASUtU-fGt6kFbvwaRc_TQc1%40thread.tacv2/conversations?groupId=330b836b-6a80-4d8f-9e17-d2d2147e7300&tenantId=dd615949-5bd0-4da0-ac52-28ef8d336373">Teams Channels</a> are for discussion, but staff won't be on there at the weekend ... we're all off having a sing along around a campfire and talking about our favourite computer programming languages.<br/>Please use the chat sensibly and respectfully, and start by letting us know your favourite computer games.</li>
    <li style="padding:1em">We are back in <b>C101</b> at <b>10am on Monday</b> - so get there in good time and <i>Radu</i> will be there to teach you about wonderful <b>Data Visualization</b> ... where there are loads of interesting graphics about various phenomena that we have captured in data, including a graphic of what I did last weekend. Here it is ... see if you can work out what it might be!<br/>

    </li>
    <li>You will also need to complete the <a href="https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/mod/page/view.php?id=420930">Processing Sound Test</a> <b>before the lecture at 10am on Monday morning</b> ... so please give that a go and remind others in class to do so as well.</li>
    </ol>
<p>OK - have a good weekend, thanks for all of your efforts this week - I think we have all made good progress.</p>
<p>Best!</p>
<p>⛺️</p>
