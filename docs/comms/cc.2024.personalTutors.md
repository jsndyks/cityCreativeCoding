Send Personal Messages:
In Moodle modules you can create a group for your tutees and send a discussion message just to this group.
These messages enable you to use codes that are filled with personal information - and personal messages seem to connect much better than "Dear Students" style messages

These messages enable you to use codes that are filled with personal information - and personal messages seem to connect much better than "Dear Students" style messages

Pick Them Up:
Try collecting tutees for a group tutorial from their lecture - see where they are on myTimetable

Help Them Filter:
Ask your tutees to set up email filters so that messages from you go into a 'Personal Tutor' folder - show them how. Dealing with email is really hard, but office has a few simple tricks that make it much more managable and make communication much more reliable. (I assume this message has gone straight into your JasonJunk folder)

Be Personal:
Learn their names.
Ask them what they would like you to call them before you meet.

Invest In Them:
Read their personal statements - they wrote these over a year ago for UCAS (in most casesd).
They are all on evision and while they are somewhat full of 'school guff' you can usually find a couple of things to ask about and these often result in a smile. Personal statements are being phased out, but the ones we have are revealing, and revealing to the students that you have read them is usually a nice experience - they like to know that you care.

Good Morning!

We have a personal tutorial at 11:15.

I think you are in The Great Hall from 9-10:50?

To get to A401E, head up the stairs outside the Great Hall and keep going up.
Up, up, up, up ... right to the top where there is a door with a key-card that I will leave open.
Push through and take a seat on the sofas.

Jason.
