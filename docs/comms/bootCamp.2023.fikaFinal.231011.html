<p>A reminder that our <b>Fika Finale</b> on <b>Friday</b> is from <b>10am-12noon</b>.</p>

<p style="color:#d02020;"><b>This is a timetabled learning activity and you are expected to attend.</b></p>
<p>Details of the location and event are on the <a href="https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/mod/page/view.php?id=460664">Welcome to BootCamp</a> page.</p>

<p>The reason that we ask you to sign up is so that we know:</p>
<ul>
    <li>numbers for food</li> 
    <li>of any dietary requirements or allergies</li> 
</ul>

<p>So, if you have not done so, please let us know here whether you would like food and drink on Friday morning here:</p>

<ul><li>CHOICE / POLL : <a href="https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/mod/choice/view.php?id=467931">Friday Fika Attendance Plans</a></li></ul>

<p>If you were under the impression that this was a voluntary class, and clicked '<b>No</b>' by mistake first time around ðŸ™ˆ ...<br />well, <b>you can update the poll if you now need refreshments</b>! Click above.</p>

<p>The CHOICE / POLL will close <b>at FOUR pm</b> today (Weds 11th).</p>

<p>Please complete or update the poll to ensure that we have accurate numbers and that there is plenty for everybody and that we minimise waste.</p>

<p>If you have dietary requirements or allergies that we need to know about please contact <b>Asif Nawaz</b>, the School's Exec Assistant - <code>asif.nawaz@city.ac.uk</code></p>
