Somebody in class noticed and mentioned that I was using keyboard shortcuts when hacking around in _Processing_ the other day.

These are handy to know.
It's good to get quick at using your software and there are lots of handy tricks.

My **top ten**, the ones I recommend using regularly, are ...

1. <code>CTRL-T</code> - tidy your code with nice indents<br/>(_do this regularly to make it readable_)
2. <code>CTRL-K</code> - open the sketch folder<br/>(_to see whether the data or images you are trying to load are really there!_)
3. <code>CTRL-R</code> - run your sketch
(ESC stops it)
4. <code>CTRL-/</code> - toggle a comment on/off - good for documenting and debugging
5. <code>CTRL-Z</code> - undo a recent change, keep clicking to keep undoing
6. <code>CTRL-SHIFT-Z</code> - redo the thing or things you just undid
7. <code>CTRL-S</code> - save the sketch - make sure you give them meaningful names
8. <code>CTRL-F</code> - find text in your code - use _replace_ too
9. <code>CTRL-G</code> - find next occurrence of text
10. <code>CTRL-N</code> - open a blank new sketch

With Mac you use the <code>COMMAND</code> key, in Windows it's <code>CTRL</code>.

Use them!
And find others!
