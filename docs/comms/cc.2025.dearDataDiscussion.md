### 24/10/25 - Dear Data Data (& Discussion)

[Moodle permalink](https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=55336#p92719)


Hi!

I have posted a couple of responses to excellent questions on the [Dear Data 100](https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/mod/page/view.php?id=967984) activity, in the [Discussion](https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/mod/forum/view.php?id=967978) area - do have a look.

Also, I was recently asked ...

> Can I collect (survey) data through a form and email everyone in the class to try to get them to fill this in?

**Please don't do this** - there are about 450 of you and if you each do this, then we will have over 200,000 emails and potentially 200,000 surveys completed.<br/>That's a lot of communication and effort.

Also, when you engage in data collection activities that involve other people _you are likely to need approval from the University_.
So please hold back from this for now to comply with Uni guidelines on the collection, storage and use of data.  

We encourage you to use the [Discussion](https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/mod/forum/view.php?id=967978) forum in Moodle to communicate with the class - please don't send email messages to the whole cohort.

So please, make this an individual (or pair / duo - see [Dear Data Duo?](https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/mod/page/view.php?id=967984) ) activity in which you observe interesting events in the world - clouds, cats, bananas, emotions, whatever - and record something about them that might be informative.

I have also had questions about what **ANONYMOUS** means.

The data should be about you, and interesting to you, but should not identify you.

So if we look at the [visualizations here](https://www.dear-data.com/week-34-a-week-of-urban-wildlife/) we know what was seen, but can't work out who saw it.

A visualization about the times and types of bananas that somebody consumed tells us about their behaviour (they tend to eat ripe bananas at the end of the week and never eat more than 5 bananas in a day) but **not who** they are.
They are not identifiable from the data.

So avoid names, addresses and other data items that could reveal your identity or that of others.
And **avoid combinations** in data  - if your data contains your _street name_, your _grandma's first name_ and your _dog's name_ ... well you might well be the only person with a Grandma called _Bettie_ and a dog called _JamieVardy_ on your street, right? You have identified yourself.

Have a look at the [Dear Data weeks](https://www.dear-data.com/by-week/) and see whether the visualizations themselves ever reveal _the author's identities_.<br/>The addresses (redacted - good idea) and comments on the legends often do, but the visualizations themselves, wisely, tend not to.

### 24/10/25 - Dear Data 100

> Do the themes have to be from dear data or can we make our own?

**Make your own**. Something that interests you. Or might interest you.

The reason for asking you to look at the [Dear Data Weeks](https://www.dear-data.com/by-week/) was to **inspire**, not **constrain**. 
So think about tweaks, or modifications or combinations of these ideas.

Be **creative**, try to think of something original by combining ideas / topics or specialising a bit. For example ...

 - todos [week 10](https://www.dear-data.com/by-week/#/week-10-1/) about family [week 29](https://www.dear-data.com/week-29-a-week-of-a-boyfriend-husband/)
 - emotions [week 11](https://www.dear-data.com/week-11-a-week-of-emotions/) you (think you) see in dogs [week 34](https://www.dear-data.com/week-34-a-week-of-urban-wildlife/)

So something that is a bit like the [Dear Data Weeks](https://www.dear-data.com/by-week/) topics, but different in ways that you like!

I am currently recording every time I eat a banana - the time of day and some of the banana characteristics:

 - how big it was;
 - how green - brown it was;
 - what I was doing (I'm often on a bike when eating a banana)

 ... which might result in some interesting visualization options.

Also - **limit the data collection** ... this needs to be lightweight and fun, and you only need 100 observations (that's quote a lot of bananas, but I am on it). So limit the data collection to particular times of day, or particular rare occurrences.

Somebody was talking about recording the clouds they saw - nice idea, but limit this by :

 - only recording about 3 or 4 things, in about 3 categories : cloud colour (dark, grey, light, white); cloud cover (full, partial, none); where you were (home, uni., park); day of week (SMTWTFS)
 - only doing it at certain times: 3 times per day (morning, afternoon, evening); 10 times per day every hour for 10 days.

And be original by specialising, by adding a modification, a twist or by combining:

 - what could I hear?
 - how was I feeling?
 - what did the clouds remind me of?
 - maybe take a photo?

Whatever!<br/>
Just try to enjoy it.

J.
