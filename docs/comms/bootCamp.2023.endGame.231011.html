<p>A reminder that we are nearing the end of <b>#BootCamp</b> and things are a little different at the end of the week.</p>

<p>Wednesday and Thursday afternoons are free for you to play with <i>Processing</i>, try things out, experiment and ultimately come up with something that you can show and explain at Friday's Fika, which is off campus and which you should attend.</p>
<p>Details of the location and event are on the <a href="https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/mod/page/view.php?id=460664">Welcome to BootCamp</a> page.</p>

<p>The thing that you show does not need to be a big thing ... it can be a lovely small thing ... or even an unlovely small thing - just a thing. A thing that you made, that you understand, and that you can explain.</p>
<p>Remember that the objective is that you ...</p>
<ul><li><b>can write an interesting piece of code<br/>that you could not have written at the start of the fortnight,<br/>that does something,<br/>and that you can explain it (what it does, how it works) to others.</b></li></ul>
<p>It would be nice if it was something you were proud of, that enabled you to find and show your <i>creative voice</i>, and that surprised us a little ... but this is not essential. Just a thing, a sketch, that shows some new capability that you can explain.</p>
<p>For this you get, food, coffee and the chance to meet other students and your personal tutor underground.</p>
<p>It is important to meet and get to know your personal tutor. They will guide you academically during your time at City and are often the person who writes a reference for you when you need a job, and internship or to apply to do another course. They are full of experience and wisdom (despite appearances) and can really help you with your studies and progress. Get to know them. Doing so will help you make progress at City and into the future.</p>
<p>See you there - you have 5 hours to update the <a href="https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/mod/choice/view.php?id=467931">Attendance Plans CHOICE</a> if you need to.</p>
<p>But before that ... I will be online at <b>10am on Thursday</b> with an interactive lecture!<br/>You will need you to do some coding ... so sign in to Zoom, and make sure you have a new <i>Processing</i> sketch open and can see the Zoom window, your Processing window and the Lecture Notes on Moodle (which will contain code snippets) concurrently.<br/>
This will all be available from 8am tomorrow.<br/>
Finishing touches being applied!
</p>
<p>Thanks, see you tomorrow!<br/>Have fun this afternoon.</p>
<p>Well done on all the good work so far.</p>
