<p>Good luck with your _Dear Data Sketches_, try to enjoy experimenting a bit, and remember that we are not looking for particularly sophisticated work - just do something that makes you feel pleased. There are no marks to be gained, but good experience and connections to be made. And you get a social media badge!</p>

<p>One thing we have not emphasized sufficiently:</p>
<p>It is easy to have an <b>IDEA</b>, to know what your <b>INTENTION</b> is for the script, but to not be able to write the <b>CODE</b> to do it.</p>
<p>This can be frustrating with lots of blockages stopping you from getting to where you had hoped to arrive.</p>

<p>We don't have the time or energy to bang our head against frustrating blockages in this task.</p>
<p><code>#CreativeCoding</code> and <i>Processing</i> work best if you have an idea, <b>see what happens when you code</b>, and <b>go where the code takes you</b>! This may be somewhere surprising, and not where you imagined in the first place! It may be interesting, revealing, satisfying! Serendipity is key here.</p>
<p>Try things out, follow your nose, and develop your ideas as to where you are going and what you are going to achieve - and make the most of what you learn on the way.</p>
<p>You might end up nowhere near where you thought you were going, but you may get somewhere interesting and learn a lot. That's the hope.</p>

<p>Take this attitude into your final week of _Dear Data_ coding as you work on your sketch.</p>

<p>I have added a few notes to the <a href="https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/mod/page/view.php?id=829277">Creativity : Core</a> materials that reflect this.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
