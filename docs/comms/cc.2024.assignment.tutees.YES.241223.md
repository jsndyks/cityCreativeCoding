Hi XXXX

- thanks for submitting a Creative Coding Sketch, I look forward to trying this out and giving you some feedback in the New Year.

For now, well done on a successful first term, and I hope you are having a bit of time off and celebrating during the Winter break.

Do let me know if you need a hand with anything or have any questions about City following a bit of time away and some reflection about your first term.

I'll see you in January!

I will be organising a group session on CreativeCoding as I did't get around to this in (a very busy) week 11 ... so watch this space!

Jason.
