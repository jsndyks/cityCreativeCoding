Meeting ID: 882 2210 5248
Passcode: cc2024

You must log in to Zoom with your City credentials to gain access - <code>yourID@city.ac.uk</code>.

Before connecting, please prepare (clean) your screen for sharing and have your mic on and camera on too if possible.

When in the room, please raise a hand if you have a question.

The meeting is open to all who are \#CreativeCoding, but I will give priority to those who have not yet met a Personal Tutor 

_(I know that this has happened to a few of you for various reasons)_

I hope to see some of you later.

Jason.
