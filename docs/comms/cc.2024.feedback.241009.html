<p>Hello Creative Coders!</p>

<p>I forgot to mention something yesterday!</p>

<p>Could you please complete the short feedback form that lets us know how you are doing so far?</p>

<ul><li><a href="https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/mod/page/view.php?id=781699">Dear Data Diary Feedback</a></li></ul>

<p>We ask a few questions in there about progress, pacing and hmmm .. what else begins with p? ðŸ¦œ</p>

<p>We need to you complete this by <b>FIRDAY</b> please.</p>

<p><b>Also</b>, I liked the sketch that I produced at the end of class, so I have made it available for you to play with:</p>
<ul><li><a href="https://jsndyks.github.io/cityCreativeCoding/html/interaction/ccInt.2024.hack.html">Interactive Class Sketch</a></li></ul>

<p><b>And</b>, I discovered yesterday that some of you have not completed the '<b>Hello Processing</b>' introduction.<br/>
Please make sure that you do this and carefully check the <a href="https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/mod/page/view.php?id=781699">Welcome to #Creative Coding</p> page!</p>

<p><b>Finally</b>, I know that some of you did not receive the green goodie bags during induction week.<br/>
    Please let us know whether this was the case through the <a href="https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/mod/page/view.php?id=781699">Dear Data Diary Feedback</a> page.<br/>
We will make sure there are bags available on Friday for you - but this will only work if people are honest. If you have a bag, please don't take another one as this will deprive your friends and colleagues. Be good!</p>

<p>If you read this message, please tell your friends about it!</p>

<p>Best!</p>

<p>Jason</p>
