<p>A reminder that <b>on Friday 6th October we will be online</b>, so <b>there is no need to travel in to the University</b>.</p>

<p>There will be live lectures for 50 minutes at <b>10am</b> and <b>5pm</b> in Zoom rooms - link to these from the Moodle home page.<br />
Please join the <b>Group Zoom rooms</b> at <b>11am</b> and <b>3pm</b> to work your way through the <i>Objects</i> and <i>Images</i> lecture notes and exercises.<br />
These will be available on the Moodle homepage on Friday morning.</p>

<p>These are important topics that introduce empowering capability - we hope you have fun with them and we look forward to discussing them with you.<br />
You should have worked through both topics by 5pm on Friday.</p>

<p>Remember:  predict, change, observe, think (and discuss), learn, confirm</p>
