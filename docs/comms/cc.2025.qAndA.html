**Please have a look**.

Attendance was a little low last week - a great shame as Giacomo's  <i>Computational Thinking</i> session is one of the best you will get in your time at University.

Equally, while less amazing, my <i>Denouement</i> session was intended to guide and inspire you towards some creative thinking and informative design activity as you complete the <i>Dear Data 100</i> task. I hope it will really help you.

I am often skeptical about 'catching up by video' - the materials are the main thing -  but on this occasion I do strongly recommend engaging with the lecture capture if you did not attend. Watch, listen and try stuff out when you are asked to download and run code - the best way to learn <code>#creativeCoding</code>.
