<p>Good luck with your demos - remember to <b>explain</b> what you have done and practice these explanations.</p>

<p>One thing we have not emphasized sufficiently:</p>
<p>It is easy to have an <b>IDEA</b>, to know what your <b>INTENTION</b> is for the script, but to not be able to write the <b>CODE</b> to do it.</p>
<p>This can be frustrating with lots of blockages stopping you from getting to where you had hoped to arrive.</p>

<p>We don't have the time or energy to bang our head against frustrating blockages.</p>
<p>BootCamp and <i>Processing</i> work best if you have an idea, <b>see what happens when you code</b>, and <b>go where the code takes you</b>!</p>
<p>Try things out, follow your nose, and develop your ideas as to where you are going and what you are going to achieve - and make the most of what you learn on the way.</p>
<p>You might end up nowhere near where you thought you were going, but you may get somewhere interesting and learn a lot.</p>

<p>Take this attitude into your final afternoon of BootCamp coding as you work on the demos.</p>
<p>And get plenty of sleep tonight, to make the most of tomorrow</p>

<p>Some people think this is a good attitude for life, and perhaps for University.<br />But that's for you to decide.</p>
<p><b>See you tomorrow (Friday).</b></p>

<p>Thanks!</p>
