#### Creative Coding Badges

> I was wondering if I needed to reference sources such as examples of code in the creative coding lectures, if I copy from some of them but made it my own by changing some of the aspects of the code and editing parts to fit my data?

Hi - nice questions!

If you **MODIFY** existing code then you need to make reference to this.

Now, in <code>#CreativeCoding</code> copying example code from the lecture notes is so fundamental to what you do, I think we can take it as read that you can use this without making direct reference to sources.

But it pains me to say this, because making direct and explicit reference to anything else that you use is absolutely fundamental to your success in coding now and int he future.

So any existing code that is not on Moodle, that you have consulted and then used directly or modified in your solutions must be identified, and you must make it easy for anybody who reads your code to find this original source.

> I also looked online on how to code certain aspects of my work to see how it's done, do I need to reference the websites I looked at?

It's good practice to list these somewhere - maybe in the code or comments, we don't specify where or how but we give a couple of examples - see the Dogs section in [Creativity : Core](https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/mod/page/view.php?id=829277) and check 'showLicenses'.

> Will I also need to do in-text citation or can I just add full citation at the end?

We don't mind how you make reference to the external sources that you have used in <code>#CreativeCoding</code>, but we would like to know about them.
In other modules you may get more specific instructions.

My understanding is that a citation is a short identifier that does not disrupt the flow of any text in which it occurs, but that links to a fuller description of a source that makes it findable - the reference. References are usually provided at the end of a document, or in a separate document.

The [ANU Library](https://libanswers.an.edu/ANU/faq/176191) describes it pretty well.

> Also, what is the style of referencing we are expected to use?

Down to you - if we don't specify, do something reasonable that allows us to find the source.
