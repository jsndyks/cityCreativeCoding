Hello everyone, we hope you are getting along well in Term II ... having fun and learning plenty.

Back in 2024 when we were hijacking your regular modules, we promised a **Creative Coding Commentary**, a **Digital Badge** and a **Pizza &amp; Data Party** in January to those of you who ...

 - made a Creative Coding assignment submission
 - engaged with personal tutorials
 - completed a feedback exercise

Well ... we're on to it, a little later than we hoped, but here's where we are at:

* **Pizza & Data Party** - **Friday 28th Feb**, in **A309**, from **12:00-12:50**<br/>
everybody from _Stage I_ is welcome to celebrate progress.

We'd like you to bring your CC memories, ideas, and sketches.
We hope that some of you will be willing to show sketches to staff and students who attend and perhaps discuss _Creative Coding_ and the _Dear Data Diaries_.
Please don't mention _Leicester City_. ðŸ¦Š.

Please come along, and encourage others to do so too.

We would love to chat about what you like and what you don't like about CC over pizza and will conduct an anonymous feedback survey in due course.
(We have our favourite and unfavourite bits too!)

**Digital Badges** will be issued to all who submitted an assignment _later today_.
Check your City emails.

**Creative Coding Commentaries** are in process.
We have delayed things a little here as we were all hit with some unexpected administrative tasks early this term as the University reorganizes itself a little. So it has been a busy time. But we will get to these as soon as we can. Leave it with us.

See you at lunchtime on **Friday 28th** - the last day of the shortest month.

**Jason**, **Giacomo**, **Golnaz**
