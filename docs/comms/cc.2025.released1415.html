Hello everyone.

We have made the materials available for a couple of the sessions in Week 08 :

 * [14. Creativity](https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/course/section.php?id=259950)
 * [15. Computational Thinking](https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/course/section.php?id=259949)

Feel free to have a look in advance of the scheduled lectures on 17th and 19th November.
Or, hang on for our introductions and work through the materials at your own pace afterwards.

In the [Creativity : Core](https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/mod/page/view.php?id=968104) materials we talk a little about the nature of the _Creative Design Process_ that we have asked you to engage in. It is worth having a look in here as you develop your Dear Data 100 ideas.

Best,

Jason.
