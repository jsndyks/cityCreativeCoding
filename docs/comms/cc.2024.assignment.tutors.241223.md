Hi folks.

I wanted to say thanks for engaging with #CreativeCoding this term.
Your efforts are very much appreciated.

We will do a full review in the New Year, but I wanted to send round a quick update.

I think we have ...

- 387 stage 1 students who engaged with CreativeCoding at some point

Of these,

- 353 engaged after reading week - week 6 - so some attrition

And we have received exactly

- 100 submissions for the voluntary Dear Data Sketch assignment.

I'm delighted - it's nice to have persuaded so many to engage in the activity.

I have added a list of the students who have submitted something, grouped by tutor here:
https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/mod/page/view.php?id=854620

Modal number of submissions per tutor is 3, so producing the Creative Coding Commentaries for your tutees should not be overwhelming.
Tracy wins the prize for productive group - 6 of her tutees have submitted.
(I have decided not to award any imaginary medals for this particular achievement just at the moment)

Instructions on what to do next will follow in the New Year - but hopefully this will be interesting quick work, that will help build relationships with the students and have downstream benefits. And not be too onerous. That's the idea anyhow.

Special thanks to Giacomo and Golnaz, and the TAs who were the backbone of CreativeCoding, but cheers to everybody for chipping in and all the best for a great break.

Jason.
