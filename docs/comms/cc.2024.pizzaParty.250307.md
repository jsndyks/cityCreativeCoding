Hello.

It was lovely to see so many of you for Pizza back at the end of February, and so many impressive creative ideas that combined code and data and some really inspiring, and sometimes revealing thinking : dancing coffee cups, spinning flowers, moving star fields, meals that made music, it was really fantastic.

We were impressed and delighted.
You achieved plenty!

Thanks for the cake and singing too - sheesh!

I hope that some / many of you who submitted a _Dear Data Diary Sketch_ have heard from your personal tutors by now.
If not, give them a little nudge - send an email - we all like to hear from you.
A quick message asking whether they have seen your Dear Data Diary, and reminding them that it's about hot drinks, steps walked, tracks played, movies watched, pizza slices eaten, or whatever, should remind them. Maybe send them a screen dump of your sketch and a couple of observations - remember that this activity is partly about them getting to know you.  

Just to remind yourselves who did submit a Dear Data Diary Sketch, I have appended a visualization to this message, and you can see it here too:

Finally, we need to ask you to help us make <code>#CreativeCoding</code> better next time.

I think I managed to persuade all of you who had pizza to help us by giving us your view on <code>#CreativeCoding</code> - but we need as many of you as possible to help us understand how it was for you: those who liked it and those who didn't, those who were inspired and those who were not. We need to hear from as many of you as possible - please take the time.

So - keep being creative, accept our thanks and praise, but don't tune out just yet!

Please do the [Creative Coding Feedback](https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/mod/feedback/view.php?id=895408)!

We'd love you to take some time to help us improve our teaching activities in the future.

Please have a think about the <code>#CreativeCoding</code> activity that we ran and answer a few questions about your experience of it.

Then take your time to provide us with realistic responses that are thoughtful, constructive and specific through the [Creative Coding Feedback](https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/mod/feedback/view.php?id=895408).

We would like you to do this as soon as possible, and certainly in the next week or so.
