Hello.

It was lovely to see so many of you for Pizza back at the end of February, and so many impressive creative ideas that combined code and data and some really inspiring, and sometimes revealing thinking.

We were impressed and delighted.
You achieved plenty!

Thanks for the cake and singing too - sheesh!

I hope that some / many of you who submitted a Dear Data Diary Sketch have heard from your personal tutors by the end of this week.
If not, give them a little nudge - we all like to hear from you.
A quick message asking whether they have seen your Dear Data Diary, and reminding them that it's about hot drinks, steps walked, tracks played, movies watched, pizza slices eaten, or whatever, should remind them. Maybe send them a screen dump and a couple of observations - remember that this activity is partly about them getting to know you.  

Just to remind yourselves who did submit a Dear Data Diary Sketch, I have appended a visualization to this message.

I will be in touch on one final occasion to ask you to help us make <code>#CreativeCoding</code> better next time.
I think I managed to persuade all of you who had pizza to help us by giving us your view on <code>#CreativeCoding</code> - but we need as many of you as possible to help us understand how it was for you: those who liked it and those who didn't, those who weer inspired and those who were not.

So - keep being creative, accept our thanks and praise, but don't tune out just yet!
