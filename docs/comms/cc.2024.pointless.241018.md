# Pointless Processing

You get no credit and you get no marks for #CreativeCoding. Nothing. Nil. Nada. <br/>
So what's the point?<br/>
Why should you invest time, effort, frustration and imagination, energy and attention into something that doesn't give you any points towards your degree?

Here are a few reasons:

## The Portfolio

We work with lots of colleagues and former students in industry and business, with friends and partners at places like Google, Meta, Microsoft and Apple. The Centre for Doctoral Training that we are setting up with £8M of government funding also has £1M backing from industrial collaborators - such as: BT; Ordnance Survey; The Natural History Museum; The Nuclear Decommissioning Agency; Genetec; Observable; The British Red Cross; The Greater London Authority.  
Increasingly we hear the importance of a portfolio when candidates are considered for technical roles.

<blockquote>The first thing an employer looks at is the GitHub repo</blockquote>

Your repo will develop over time, but getting started early, and having commits now, getting into the habit and ensuring regular commits as you move through your degree will give you something very valuable.
Using GitHub as a means of securing, protecting and developing your work is important in terms of the skills you wil gain and the resources you will develop. Develop a portfolio of Processing sketches to show the scope of your work and the creativity that you are capable of. Develop a graphical component to your portfolio to impress.

## The Academic

Knowing an academic is useful. They have experience, they have connections, they can make recommendations.
The academic you will probably get to know best during your time at University is your Personal Tutor.

#CreativeCoding gives you a chance to get to know them on your terms, share with them in ways that reveal something about you. Show them something that interests you, something about you, something you have created ... and use this focus to develop your relationship with them.

This will help you develop some rapport with your tutor as they provide guidance and advice throughout your time at City - when things are good, and perhaps when things are not going quite so well.

## The Commentary

We spend a fair amount of time providing references to current and former students to help them make progress in their careers. Sometimes this is immediately after graduation, sometimes it is 10 years down the line.

#CreativeCoding will give you a personal paragraph that describes your approach to and engagement with the activity. We are looking for initiative, participation, creativity, and groupwork capability in Creative Coding and the tutorials, and would like to write something that is personal. about you, that reflects your style, approach and contribution - something that presents you as a capable, thoughtful and reliable candidate, that makes you stand out.
Personal references are important, and this gives you a chance to stand out and make an impact.

Each tutor will prod a summary of your participation, work and --- that is ready for the start of term 2. This will be something that they can draw upon subsequently when you request references in the future.

## The Pointless

There is some concern amongst us teachers around the increasing focus on _marks as motivation_. And yet there is more to life, education and University than mark optimization. The marks are only part of the picture.

It sometimes feels as though schools are training students to play a game that optimises grades with channelled guidance on where to put effort. This will not work well at University, where tasks get more complex and solutions to the questions that we ask become more diverse, less easy to specify, more unknown at the outset.

It does not translate well to the World of work either. So we want to confront this early on in your course. You will need to do things that have unknown, uncertain vague or long term benefit, and we will advise you on this. You will not only need to do things that have obvious immediate effects on your grades.

Of course, if you think for a minute, there are plenty of obvious examples:

But getting involved in a variety of activities that provide some diversity, and a rounded education will help you:

- friends - finding like-minded people, spending time with them, learning from them - remember Golnaz's advice
- fun things - keep your motivation up, your mind fresh, yourself happy by investing in fun stuff - we all need a break
- careers - engage with the University's careers service. Data shows that those who do so sooner are more likely to be employed at the ends of their degrees.
- sleep - you don't get points for sleeping, but recovery and rest are essential for effective study (and basic functioning and most other things)
- nutrition - see above
- exercise - see above
- spirituality - very important for some of us
- football - very important for some of us too
- family - many of us are lucky enough to have caring commitments and dependencies, see 'fun things'!
- clubs - engage with the Computer Society for some excellent experience, training and to connect with, learn from and enjoy the company of colleagues in your discipline across years
- paid employment - helps you study, gives you experience, doesn't deliver grades directly
- stage 1 - when you come to think of it - the whole the whole of yur first year, which you need to pass, but while what you learn in year 1 will form a foundation as you go on in your degree to study more sophisticated subjects that build upon this, your marks (that appear on your transcript) make no contribution to your final degree class.

Actually, even writing this message doesn't get me any points.
But I think and hope it's worthwhile.

## The Experience

#CreativeCoding deliberately exposes you to some approaches that help you learning to learn at University.

You are using online resources &amp; reading lists.
You are dealing with tasks that are specified without model answers, tasks that build from a specification that can be interpreted and addressed in multiple ways, rather than tasks that build to a target.

You are learning to be creative, understanding how to stand out and gaining experience of how to select and work on a topic that is of interest to you will set you up well for University education, in particular the project in your final year.

You aer using open discussion boards (not much action here), engaging and working with colleagues, getting to know the TAs and how to get help.

At the start of term, one colleague said to me that:

<blockquote>If [the students] get to year 2 knowing that they have to work, and knowing how to do it then that's a success</blockquote>

#CreativeCoding is designed to help you learn to learn.

## The Expertise

Between us, the team that has planned, approved, delivered and put their own time, effort, frustration and imagination into #CreativeCoding has hundreds of years of University teaching experience at a range of i institutions.

We have developed these ideas, lectures, examples and resources because in our experience and opinion they give you important learning opportunities and experiences.

If you don't take part, if you don't attend, try, embrace the #CreativeCoding culture, then you are rejecting this experience and guidance. That is your prerogative, and yet we encourage you to draw upon the knowledge, experience and advice of the academics at University. These people are aty the forefront of their research fields in Computer Science - they see the future. They have vast experience of University education - they know the past. We strongly encourage you to trust their judgment and engage in all teaching activities. In particular have designed #CreativeCoding to help you :

- get to know people
- introduce key programming concepts
- encourage creative thinking
- encourage computational thinking
- encourage you to get to know yourselves and your peers through data, and to reflect on your relationship with data
- develop the Y1 CS community
- learn some core technology for productivity & collaboration and practice
- build relationships between students and tutors

We are striving to enable you achieve these things and to support you in doing so.
Please engage.
