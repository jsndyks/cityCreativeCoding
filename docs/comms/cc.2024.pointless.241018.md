# Pointless Processing

You get no credit and you get no marks for #CreativeCoding, so what's the point?
Why should you invest time, effort, frustration and imagination into something that doesn't give you any points towards your degree?

Here are a few reasons:

## The Portfolio

<blockquote>The first thing an employer looks at is the GitHub repo</blockquote>

Your repo will develop over timer, but having commits now, having regular commits as you move through your degree, and using GitHub as a means of securing, protecting and developing your work is important in terms of the skills you wil gain and the resources you will develop.

## The Academic

Knowing an academic is useful. They have experience, they can make recommendations.
The academic you will probably get to know best during your time at University is your Personal Tutor. #CreativeCoding gives you a chance to get to know them omn your terms. Show them something that interests you, something about you, something you have created ... and use this focus to develop your relationship with them.

Advice, guidance,

## The Commentary

Personal references are important

## The Pointless

There is some concern amongst us teachers around the increasing focus on marks as motivation. It sometimes feels as though schools are training students to play a game that optimises grades with channelled guidance on where to put effort. Thus will not work well at University, where tasks get more complex and solutions to the questions that we ask become more divers, less eay to specify, more unknown at the outset. It does not translate well to the World of work, so we want to confront this early on in your course. You will need to do things that have unknown, uncertain vague or long term benefit, and we will advise you on this. You will not only need to do things that have obvious immediate effects on your grades.

Of course there are plenty of obvious examples.

But getting involved in a variety of activities that provide some diversity, and a rounded education will help you:

- friends
- fun things
- careers
- sleep - you don't get points for sleeping, but recovery and rest are essential for effective stud (and most other things)
- nutrition - see above
- exercise - see above
- spirituality - very important for some of us
- football - very important for some of us too
- family - many of us are lucky enough to have caring commitments and dependencies
- work - helps you study, gives you experience, doesn't deliver grades directly
- and when you come to think of it - the whole if Stage 1, which you need to pass, but while what you learn will form the foundation of what you go on to do laster on in your degree, your marks (that appear on your transcript) make no contribution to your degree class.

Actually, even writing this message doesn't get me any points.
But I think and hope it's worthwhile.

## The Experience

Learning to learn.
Using online resources &amp; reading lists.
Dealing with tasks that are specified without model answers.
Being creative, understanding how to stand out and having experience of how to select and work on a topic that is of interest to you will set you up well for University education, in particular the project in your final year.  
usgin discussion boards,m working with colleagues, getting to knwo the TAs and how to get help.

#CreativeCoding is helping you learn to learn.

##Â The Expertise

Between us, the team that has planned, approved, delivered and put their own time, effort, frustration and imagination into #CreativeCoding has hundreds of yearts of teaching experience.

We have developed these ideas, lectures, examples and resources because in our experience and opinion they give you important learning opportunities and experiences.

If you don't take part, if you don't attend, try, embrace the CC culture, then you are rejecting this experience and guidance. We think it will help you :

- get to know people
- concepts
- data
- outcomes

We are striving to enable you achieve these things.
