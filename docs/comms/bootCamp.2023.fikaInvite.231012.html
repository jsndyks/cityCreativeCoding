<p><a href="https://hejsweden.com/en/have-coffee-breaks-called-fika-swedish/"><i>Fika</i></a> is (apparently, supposedly) '<i>coffee</i>' backwards in 19th century Swedish!</p>
<ul><li>kaffi -> ffi-ka -> fika</li></ul>
<p>It describes a tradition in which people who are often working together stop to meet, chat, exchange knowledge, opinions and work out where they are at.
    Usually with a coffee, but other options are available. Sounds nice, right?</p>
<p>We are finishing <i>Coding BootCamp</i>, our two week intensive introduction to creative coding that we impose upon all of our fresh CS undergraduates with <b>fika</b> Friday as we want to encourage students to take time to stop, reflect and discuss their learning, their progress and their learning needs as they start their degrees. We want to set up some good practice here. And we want to reward students and staff for a full and busy two weeks and get them to discuss their experiences, their successes and their failures, and ours too, with colleagues, tutors and others in the Department of Computer Science.</p>
<p>So please come along - <b>we need you there</b>.</p>
<p>We need you to find and engage with your tutees.</p>
<p>We gave students a target - at our <b>fika</b> Friday we would like them to ...</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>show up</b> - have something to eat and drink</li>
    <li><b>meet you - their personal tutor</b> - your are their academic guide for the next few years, somebody they need to get to know</li>
    <li><b>identify and explain</b> - an interesting piece of <code>code</code> that they could not have written at the start of <code>#BootCamp</code> and explain what it does</li>
    <li><b>show</b> - something that they have produced</li>
    <li><b>see</b> - what others have done, and chat to them. Find out how they did it, what they learned, and get them to <b>explain</b> - <b>fika</b>!</li>
</ul>
<p><b>You are a big part of this. Please play your role. We have ordered coffee and some breakfast for you.</b></p>
<p>Also, please get there on time - ready for a 10am start. We are trying to encourage and model punctual behaviour.</p>

<p>Our <b>Fika Friday</b> is <b>tomorrow</b> - on <b>13th October</b>, from <b>10am-12 noon</b>.</p>
<p>It's at <i><a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/1QYyVsqwaDe1HEbY6">The Crypt on The Green</a></i> - a nice venue that is just down the road from the Uni at <i><a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/ijSTdqWYkKygnRN17">Clerkenwell Green</a></i>. It's a 10 minute walk down St John Street (take a left) from The College Building.</p>

<p style="padding-top:12.25em">You can check your personal tutees here - and perhaps print this and use it as a check-list:</p>
<ul><li><i><a href="https://cityuni-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/j_dykes_city_ac_uk/EWwvu2DBfwBNj2zQe7nAffQBO4FzbiuBUoRZP5diSFfxug?e=ndy691">bootCamp.2023.studentList.tutors.pdf</a></i></li></ul>

<p>A reminder that students have been asked to:</p>
<ul>
   <li>write an piece of code (a Processing sketch)</li>
   <li>that they could not have written two weeks ago,
   <li>that does something<br/>(interesting, pretty, surprising), <-- low barrier</li>
   <li>that they can explain to others<br/>(what it does, how it works)</li> 
</ul>

<p>We'd like you to help us find out and let us now whether this has happened.</p>

<p>We actually need to make some decisions about BootCamp as the cohort grows, the institution changes and teaching and curricula adapt.
So, it would be great if you could:</p>
<ul>
   <li>ask students about their programming experience before BootCamp, and how (whether) BootCamp tied in with this</li>
   <li>find out how BootCamp was for them - what did they learn, where did they struggle, and how their demo (code, explanation) reflects that.</li> 
   <li>inform them about what's next - and how modules and your personal tutorials will work, for example</li>
</ul>

<p>When we started off, and I was asked to coordinate BootCamp, I asked the CS senior management what the point of BootCamp was - what we were trying to achieve.</p>
<p>I attach a synthesis. I hope that tomorrow you can contribute to these objectives, and also poke around a bit to help get a sense of where we have succeeded and where we haven't.</p>
<p>Do let Radu and I know.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
