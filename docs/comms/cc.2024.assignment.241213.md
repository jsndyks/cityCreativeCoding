Thanks to those of you who have submitted a _Dear Data Sketch_ assignment.

We're really pleased that so many of you have done so, and will check the sketches and work on the badges and commentaries in the next few weeks.

I can already see some interesting and exciting #CreativeCoding, this is great!

I also want to say _thanks_ for being an attentive and patient class - a pleasure to learn with. I _almost_ miss standing in front of 300+ of you and forgetting how to code as I try to see a keyboard that is too close to me while looking over my shoulder to try to make out what I am typing a a fire alarm starts ringing. Almost.

**SERIOUS BIT:**<br/>
For regular assessments in Credit-bearing modules, missing a deadline is **serious**.<br/>It may mean that your work is not marked.<br/>You may receive a mark of ZERO if your work is a second late.<br/>This may stop you from passing a module and may stop you from progressing from one stage to another.

Enough of you have submitted late work for me to be a little bit worried about this.

Assessment at University is not about you doing the best work that you can.<br/>
It is about you doing the best work that you can in the time that we give you.<br/>If you take more time, it doesn't count. So managing your time well is vital.

In my experience, students who receive a mark of ZERO when they submit their work a second late often claim that this is unfair. But it's not. Fair, means treating everybody in the same way and being clear about how everybody will be treated: clarity, consistency &amp; transparency are fair in assessment. Giving a few people a few extra seconds is not fair - particularly when others who did what they were asked and had a few minutes or (if they were smart and planned things well) hours less to complete their work is inconsistent and unfair. Those who miss the deadline often fail to see the excellent planning and compromises and judgment of those who make it. We have to treat everybody in the same way.<br/> So **do not expect your work to be marked if you miss a deadline**.

_H&nbsp;o&nbsp;w&nbsp;e&nbsp;v&nbsp;e&nbsp;r_ ... while not wanting to get you into bad habits (hence the serious stuff above), I have left the submission area open for a few days as a few people have said that they would like a little more time.

It's still here:

- https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/mod/assign/view.php?id=829302

But ...

- I ask you **not to resubmit if you have already submitted something that works** - have the weekend off and FaceTime your family and tell them how much you love them instead. Or watch Leicester City struggle to a narrow away win up in Newcastle. Or both, plus something else that's fun and up your street and #Creative.

* If **you have not yet submitted**, then there is still a chance to do so, but don't let the #CreativeCoding compromise other assessed work that you need to complete in the next week.

* If **you submitted something incomplete or broken**, well that's OK, you may want to leave it there - well done for getting this far. But feel free to try to fix things if you find that interesting, useful and beneficial. Resubmit if you decide to move things forwards in the next seven days. But see above re: _compromise other assessed work that you need to complete in the next week._

OK - you made it to the end of week 11 despite 8 lectures being HiJacked by the #CreativeCoding Crew!

Well done, and thanks for the fun.
