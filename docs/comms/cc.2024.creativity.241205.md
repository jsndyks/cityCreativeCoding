#### Creativity : Core

I have added some notes to [Creativity : Core](https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/mod/page/view.php?id=829277), specifically:

- **3. (Dear Data Diary) Design Process ...**

An explanation of the _Design Process_ and the way that we hope and expect and recommend that you use your data and ideas in the _Dear Data Sketch_.

- **4. Data Dogs**

The code that I introduced in the [Creativity : Lecture](https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/mod/url/view.php?id=836206) (from <code>24:54 - 30:00</code>) in which I used classes, interaction, data and sound to riff on (_Combine, Adapt, Substitute_) Giorgia Lupi's _Dear Data_ sketch that involved depictions of all the dogs she encountered.

I hope that these notes and examples will help as you work on the sketches.

Jason.
