<p>Hello Again!</p>

<P>Some of you have not collected any data yet - please do so, you will get much more from the <code>#CreativeCoding</code> activity if you engage.</P>
<p>To give you a hand, and in response to a couple of questions we describe what data are and give you some ideas about how you might record them here:</p>
<ul><li><a href="https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/mod/page/view.php?id=818121">https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/mod/page/view.php?id=818121</a></li></ul>
<p>As well as '<i>what?</i>', there is the '<i>when</i>' question.</p>
<p>Well you collect data whenever you observe something that is interesting and needs recording - hence the need to make data collection easy.</p>
<p>But also, there is the '<i>over what period(s)</i>' question.</p>
<p>Well we hope that some of you started collecting data weeks ago and continue to do so.</p>
<p>But if you have not started, consider weeks 06 and 07 as an interesting data collection window.</p>
<p>These two weeks are very different - <i>Reading Week</i> starts on 5th November, and then you have a <i>week of regular term</i>.</p>
<p>Your data recording activity may capture the differences.
    And then why not continue for week 08 to see whether it it more similar to week 07 (as might be expected) or week 06?</p>
<p>This is a really good opportunity to start recording what yuo see, and the more you see, and the more you collect, the more richly describe the phenomenon that you are interested in, the more expressive, interesting and useful the visualization you produce will be.</p>
<p>If you have not yet started - go for it ... start observing and recording!</p>
<p>Hopefully this new page, and the suggestion that you collect over the next fortnight, help a little.</p>

<p>Have a good (data collecting?) weekend,</p>
<p>Jason.</p>
