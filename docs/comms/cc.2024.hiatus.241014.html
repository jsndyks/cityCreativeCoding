<p>Hello Again Creative Coders!</p>
<p>Thanks for participating in the first four #CreativeCoding sessions.</p>
<p>#CreativeCoding happens in weeks 1 & 2, and then again in weeks 7 & 8 … and then we have a party in week 11 at the end of term. <br/>
    So you won't see Giacomo, Golnaz and I for a little while as ‘normal service', your assessed modules, resumes.</p>

<p>This week you have your regular assessed modules - with <b>IN1007 Java</b> starting tomorrow (Tuesday) and <b>IN1006 Systems Architecture</b> on Friday - check MyTimetable for details. Please arrive on time for my colleagues <b>Mai</b> and <b>Asad</b>, and please give them as much attention and thanks as you did for us in Creative Coding, it's appreciated!</p>

<p>Thanks for the <b>feedback</b> too … we can see that some of you think we area going too quickly and some think we are going too slowly, which is about what we expect. You have a very wide range of capabilities and one of the reasons for CC is to give you all a common grounding in some key programming concepts.</p>
<p>But, we have fewer responses than we would like - just 66 ... so we have re-opened the feedback activity for another week.</p>
<p>So, could you please complete the short feedback form if you have not already done so?<br/><b>DEADLINE - FRIDAY 18th</b></p>

<ul><li><a href="https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/mod/page/view.php?id=781699">Dear Data Diary Feedback</a></li></ul>


<p>In the meantime … we hope that you will continue to work through the #CreativeCoding materials and examples, write sketches, push them to GitHub and in particular use, methods, interactions, and classes to develop a portfolio of code.</p>

<p>This week I will add a few notes to help:</p>
<ul><li>some explanatory videos</li>
<li>some updated examples</li>
<li>a rationale that addresses the “<i>why should I do something that involves no credit?</i>” question</li>
<li>stuff about dogs &amp; robots</li></ul>

<p>Watch this space - and please try to engage with your tutors with ideas and questions about the Dear Data side of things.</p>
<p>Best!</p>
<p>Jason</p>
