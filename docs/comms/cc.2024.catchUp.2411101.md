Hello!

I notice that you have not checked in with the Creative Coding module since before the last class in week 2.

We're really keen that you participate, so we would like to point you to a couple of things that might help!

1. A new document that explains why Creative Coding is important and aim to motivate you to participate : https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/mod/page/view.php?id=817952

2. Catch-up sessions being run by our TAs - they will let you know about where and when in separate communication, but these are intended to help you get up to speed.

So please connect with the Creative Coding materials, read through the notes, try the examples, use the discussion board and most importantly come to classes.

We get going again on Monday 11th and Thursday 14th with some exciting on Images, Data and Visualization that we think you will find empowering.

So please ...

1. Use Reading Week (week 06) to engage with the Creative Coding activity and get up to speed
2. Attend catch-up sessions and use the discussion boards to get help
3. Come along in week 07 to participate in the lectures

And drop me a line if you'd like to discuss any of this.

Cheers!

Jason & the Teaching Team
