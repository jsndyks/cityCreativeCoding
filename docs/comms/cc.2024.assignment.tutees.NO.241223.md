Hi XXXX

I just wanted to say well done on well done what seems to have been a successful first term, and I hope you are having a bit of time off and celebrating during the Winter break.

Do reflect on what you learned in term 1 - about Uni, about learning, about yourself and about the subjects that you have been focussing on. It's always useful to think back as you plan forwards. Breaks are a great time for this - what are you pleased with, what could have gone better, what will you do differently next term?

Do let me know if you need a hand with anything or have any questions about City following a bit of time away and some reflection about your first term.

I will be organising a group tutorial session on CreativeCoding as I didn't get around to this in (a very busy) week 11 ... so watch this space!

I see that you didn't submit a Dear Data Sketch, but I would like to catch up on your coding progress and see some of what you have produced in CC or Java in the New Year.

I'll see you in January!

Best,

Jason.
