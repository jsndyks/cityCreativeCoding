<p>We're ONLINE on Thursday morning at 10am - links and instructions here:</p>
<ul><li><a href="https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=6081#section-20">Example Sketch (Thu AM, ONLINE with Jason)</a></li></ul>
<p>See you in the Zoom room at 10 am.</p>
<p>Labs will follow in the University at 11am, so please engage with the lecture on campus.</p>

<p>The labs and the free afternoon will give you chance to work on your demo for Friday.
<br />Remember that the objective is that you ...</p>
<ul><li><b>can write an interesting piece of code<br />
that you could not have written at the start of the fortnight,<br />
that does something,<br />
and that you can explain it (what it does, how it works) to others.</b></li></ul>

<p>Thursday's Zoom lecture is intended to get you relating concepts together to help with that.</p>
<p><b>Jason.</b></p>
